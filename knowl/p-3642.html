<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, and let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be distinct vertices (if <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> only has one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically).  We must show two things to show that there is a unique path between <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{:}\)</span> that there is a path, and that there is not more than one path.  The first of these is automatic, since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.</div>
