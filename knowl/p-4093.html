<li><div class="para">False. To prove this, we can give an example of a pair of graphs with the same chromatic number that are not isomorphic. For example, <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,4}\)</span> both have chromatic number 2, but are not isomorphic.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">False. The previous example does not work, but you can easily draw two trees that have the same number of vertices and edges but are not isomorphic. Since all trees have chromatic number 2, this is a counterexample.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">True. If there is an isomorphism from <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> then we have a bijection that tells us how to match up vertices between the graph. Any proper vertex coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> will tell us how to properly color <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> simply by coloring <span class="process-math">\(f(v_i)\)</span> the same color as <span class="process-math">\(v_i\text{,}\)</span> for each vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_i \in V\text{.}\)</span> That is, color the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(G_2\)</span> exactly how you color the corresponding vertices in <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, any proper vertex coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G_2\)</span> corresponds to a proper vertex coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{.}\)</span> Thus the smallest number of colors needed to properly color <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> cannot be smaller than the smallest number of colors needed to properly color <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> and vice-versa, so the chromatic numbers must be equal.</div></li>
