For those examples which include <em class="emphasis">problems</em>, full solutions are included. Before reading the solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking. Unlike some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all inclusive for problems you will see in the exercises. They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other problems. Instead, use the examples to deepen our understanding of the concepts and techniques discussed in each section. Then use this understanding to solve the exercises at the end of each section.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-2.html#WqP" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
