<div class="para">Note first that whenever <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> are both true statements, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> must be true as well. For this problem, take <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to mean “Sue gets a 93% on her final” and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> to mean “Sue will get an A in the class.”</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">We have <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> follows. Sue gets an A.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then she gets a 93% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The contrapositive of the converse of <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\neg P \imp \neg Q\text{,}\)</span> which states that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final, then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What would happen if Sue does not get an A but <em class="emphasis">did</em> get a 93% on the final? Then <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> would be true and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> would be false. This makes the implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> false! It must be that Sue did not get a 93% on the final. Notice now we have the implication <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q \imp \neg P\)</span> which is the contrapositive of <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is assumed to be true, we know <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q \imp \neg P\)</span> is true as well.</div></li>
