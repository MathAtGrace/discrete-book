<div class="para">Note that it doesn't make sense to ask for the number of <em class="emphasis">bijections</em> here, as there are none (because the codomain is larger than the domain, there are no surjections). But for a function to be injective, we just can't use an element of the codomain more than once.</div> <div class="para">We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image of 1. There are 8 choices. Then we need to pick one of the remaining 7 elements to be the image of 2. Finally, one of the remaining 6 elements must be the image of 3. So the total number of functions is <span class="process-math">\(8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 = P(8,3)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">What this demonstrates in general is that the number of injections <span class="process-math">\(f:A \to B\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\card{A} = k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\card{B} = n\text{,}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(P(n,k)\text{.}\)</span>
