<li><div class="para">On the first day, your 2 mini bunnies become 2 large bunnies. On day 2, your two large bunnies produce 4 mini bunnies. On day 3, you have 4 mini bunnies (produced by your 2 large bunnies) plus 6 large bunnies (your original 2 plus the 4 newly matured bunnies). On day 4, you will have <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> mini bunnies (2 for each of the 6 large bunnies) plus 10 large bunnies (your previous 6 plus the 4 newly matured). The sequence of total bunnies is <span class="process-math">\(2, 2, 6, 10, 22, 42\ldots\)</span> starting with <span class="process-math">\(a_0 = 2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_1 = 2\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}\text{.}\)</span> This is because the number of bunnies is equal to the number of bunnies you had the previous day (both mini and large) plus 2 times the number you had the day before that (since all bunnies you had 2 days ago are now large and producing 2 new bunnies each).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Using the characteristic root technique, we find <span class="process-math">\(a_n = a2^n + b(-1)^n\text{,}\)</span> and we can find <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to give <span class="process-math">\(a_n = \frac{4}{3}2^n + \frac{2}{3}(-1)^n\text{.}\)</span>
