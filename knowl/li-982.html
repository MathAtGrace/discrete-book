<span class="process-math">\((3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, \ldots)\text{.}\)</span> These are all triangular numbers. However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term. So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <span class="process-math">\(T_n\text{,}\)</span> we would be set. Therefore the closed formula is <span class="process-math">\(e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(n+3\)</span> came from <span class="process-math">\((n+2)+1\)</span>). Thinking about sequences as functions, we are doing a horizontal shift by 2: <span class="process-math">\(e_n = T_{n+2}\)</span> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_seq_intro.html#uAa" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
