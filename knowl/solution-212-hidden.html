<li><div class="para">As we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-deltak.html" title="Example 2.3.1">ExampleÂ 2.3.1</a>, this sequence is not <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^k\)</span>-constant for any <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Therefore the closed formula for the sequence is not a polynomial. In fact, we know the closed formula is <span class="process-math">\(a_n = 2^n\text{,}\)</span> which grows faster than any polynomial (so is not a polynomial).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The sequence of first differences is <span class="process-math">\(7, 43, 133, 301, 571,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> The second differences are: <span class="process-math">\(36, 90, 168, 270,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Third difference: <span class="process-math">\(54, 78, 102,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Fourth differences: <span class="process-math">\(24, 24, \ldots\text{.}\)</span> As far as we can tell, this sequence of differences is constant so the sequence is <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^4\)</span>-constant and as such the closed formula is a degree 4 polynomial.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">This is the Fibonacci sequence.  The sequence of first differences is <span class="process-math">\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots\text{,}\)</span> the second differences are <span class="process-math">\(1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5\ldots\text{.}\)</span> We notice that after the first few terms, we get the original sequence back. So there will never be constant differences, so the closed formula for the Fibonacci sequence is not a polynomial.</div></li>
