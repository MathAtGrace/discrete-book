<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">Euler path</dfn>, in a graph or multigraph, is a walk through the graph which uses every edge exactly once. An <dfn class="terminology">Euler circuit</dfn> is an Euler path which starts and stops at the same vertex. Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph (or multigraph) has an Euler path or circuit.</div>
