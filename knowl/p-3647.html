<div class="para">Read the proof above very carefully.  Notice that both directions had two parts: the existence of paths, and the uniqueness of paths (which related to the fact that there were no cycles).  In this case, these two parts were really separate.  In fact, if we just considered graphs with no cycles (a forest), then we could still do the parts of the proof that explore the uniqueness of paths between vertices, even if there might not <em class="emphasis">exist</em> paths between vertices.</div>
