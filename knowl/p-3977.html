<div class="para"> Suppose you have a bipartite graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> This will consist of two sets of vertices <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> with some edges connecting some vertices of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to some vertices in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> or both in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>). A <dfn class="terminology">matching of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span></dfn> is a subset of the edges for which each vertex of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> belongs to exactly one edge of the subset, and no vertex in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> belongs to more than one edge in the subset. In practice we will assume that <span class="process-math">\(|A| = |B|\)</span> (the two sets have the same number of vertices) so this says that every vertex in the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the matching.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-23-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a>
