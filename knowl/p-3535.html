<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are a lot of definitions to keep track of in graph theory. Here is a glossary of the terms we have already used and will soon encounter.</div>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Graph</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A collection of <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn>, some of which are connected by <dfn class="terminology">edges</dfn>. More precisely, a pair of sets <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a set of vertices and <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a set of 2-element subsets of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span>
</div></dd>
<dt>Adjacent</dt>
<dd><div class="para">Two vertices are <dfn class="terminology">adjacent</dfn> if they are connected by an edge. Two edges are <dfn class="terminology">adjacent</dfn> if they share a vertex.</div></dd>
<dt>Bipartite graph</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A graph for which it is possible to divide the vertices into two disjoint sets such that there are no edges between any two vertices in the same set.</div></dd>
<dt>Complete bipartite graph</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A bipartite graph for which every vertex in the first set is adjacent to every vertex in the second set.</div></dd>
<dt>Complete graph</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A graph in which every pair of vertices is adjacent.</div></dd>
<dt>Connected</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A graph is <dfn class="terminology">connected</dfn> if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex.</div></dd>
<dt>Chromatic number</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The minimum number of colors required in a proper vertex coloring of the graph.</div></dd>
<dt>Cycle</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A path (see below) that starts and stops at the same vertex, but contains no other repeated vertices.</div></dd>
<dt>Degree of a vertex</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The number of edges incident to a vertex.</div></dd>
<dt>Euler path</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A walk which uses each edge exactly once.</div></dd>
<dt>Euler circuit</dt>
<dd><div class="para">An Euler path which starts and stops at the same vertex.</div></dd>
<dt>Multigraph</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">multigraph</dfn> is just like a graph but can contain multiple edges between two vertices as well as single edge loops (that is an edge from a vertex to itself).</div></dd>
<dt>Path</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn> is a walk that doesn't repeat any vertices (or edges) except perhaps the first and last. If a path starts and ends at the same vertex, it is called a <dfn class="terminology">cycle</dfn>.</div></dd>
<dt>Planar</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A graph which can be drawn (in the plane) without any edges crossing.</div></dd>
<dt>Subgraph</dt>
<dd><div class="para">We say that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">subgraph</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> if every vertex and edge of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is also a vertex or edge of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> We say <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is an <dfn class="terminology">induced</dfn> subgraph of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> if every vertex of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a vertex of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and each pair of vertices in <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> are adjacent in <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> if and only if they are adjacent in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
</div></dd>
<dt>Tree</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A connected graph with no cycles. (If we remove the requirement that the graph is connected, the graph is called a <dfn class="terminology">forest</dfn>.) The vertices in a tree with degree 1 are called <dfn class="terminology">leaves</dfn>.</div></dd>
<dt>Vertex coloring</dt>
<dd><div class="para">An assignment of colors to each of the vertices of a graph. A vertex coloring is <dfn class="terminology">proper</dfn> if adjacent vertices are always colored differently.</div></dd>
<dt>Walk</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A sequence of vertices such that consecutive vertices (in the sequence) are adjacent (in the graph). A walk in which no edge is repeated is called a <dfn class="terminology">trail</dfn>, and a trail in which no vertex is repeated (except possibly the first and last) is called a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>.</div></dd>
