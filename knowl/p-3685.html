<div class="para">How do we know?  We can give an algorithm for <em class="emphasis">finding</em> a spanning tree!  Start with a connected graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>  If there is no cycle, then <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is already a tree and we are done.  If there is a cycle, let <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> be any edge in that cycle and consider the new graph <span class="process-math">\(G_1 = G - e\)</span> (i.e., the graph you get by deleting <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span>).  This tree is still connected since <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> belonged to a cycle, there were at least two paths between its incident vertices.  Now repeat: if <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> has no cycles, we are done, otherwise define <span class="process-math">\(G_2\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(G_1 - e_1\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(e_1\)</span> is an edge in a cycle in <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{.}\)</span>  Keep going.  This process must eventually stop, since there are only a finite number of edges to remove.  The result will be a tree, and since we never removed any vertex, a <em class="emphasis">spanning</em> tree.</div>
