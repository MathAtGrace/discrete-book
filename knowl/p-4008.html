<div class="para">What question we ask about the graph depends on the application, but often leads to deeper, general and abstract questions worth studying in their own right. Here is a short summary of the types of questions we have considered:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Can the graph be drawn in the plane without edges crossing? If so, how many regions does this drawing divide the plane into?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Is it possible to color the vertices of the graph so that related vertices have different colors using a small number of colors? How many colors are needed?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Is it possible to trace over every edge of a graph exactly once without lifting up your pencil? What other sorts of “paths” might a graph posses?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Can you find subgraphs with certain properties? For example, when does a (bipartite) graph contain a subgraph in which all vertices are only related to one other vertex?</div></li>
</ul>
