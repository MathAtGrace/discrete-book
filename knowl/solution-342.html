<div class="para">If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex, and each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet, we would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2 (for example, <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> would be adjacent to both <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span>). By Brooks' theorem, this graph has chromatic number at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph and the graph is not a complete graph or odd cycle. Thus only two boxes are needed.</div>
