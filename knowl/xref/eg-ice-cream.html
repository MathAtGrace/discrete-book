<div class="para">Suppose an ice cream shop has 31 flavors.  After saving your allowance, you decide to splurge on a three-scoop ice cream treat. How many choices do you have?  And why are there at least three correct answers to this question?</div>
<div class="solutions"><details class="solution solution-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></summary><div class="solution solution-like knowl__content">
<div class="para">What the answer is depends on how we interpret the question.  We want to buy three scoops.  Do those scoops have to be all different flavors?  Are we getting a cone or a shake?  (Because perhaps we care about which scoop is on top in a cone, but in a shake, they will be blended up).</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Suppose first we want three distinct flavors in a cone.  Each option is then a <em class="emphasis">sequence</em> of <em class="emphasis">distinct</em> elements.  Some of these are:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">(Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Vanilla, Strawberry, Chocolate)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Rocky road, Strawberry, Mint chocolate chip)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">etc.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Since we are counting sequences, we use a permutation:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(31,3) = 31\cdot 30 \cdot 29 = 26970\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">If we wanted a shake with three distinct flavors, we need only specify which flavors are in our <em class="emphasis">set</em> of flavors, not the order/sequence they come in.  So we count subsets, which is done with a combination:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\binom{31}{3} = \frac{31\cdot 30\cdot 29}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1} = 4495\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">As we noticed previously, this will be <span class="process-math">\(1/6\)</span> the number of sequences, since each set of three flavors corresponds to six sequences with those flavors.</div>
</div> <div class="para">What if we allow repeated flavors?  For cones, we know how to answer this.  We are counting sequences of not-necessarily-distinct elements.  (Chocolate, Vanilla, Chocolate) is one outcome.  A separate one is (Chocolate, Chocolate, Vanilla).  We have 31 choices for each position, so our answer is <span class="process-math">\(31^3\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Could we count how many shakes there are with repeat flavors allowed?  This would be like counting sets, but where we can include an element in the set more than once.  This is what we donâ€™t know how to do yet.</div>
