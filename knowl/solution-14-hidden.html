Thus the only way to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\forall x

<li><div class="para">We are simply claiming that there is some element <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in the domain of discourse for which <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Here we are claiming that no element we find will make <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> true.
