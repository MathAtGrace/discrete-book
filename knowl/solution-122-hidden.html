<div class="para">We get six scoops, each of which could be one of ten possible flavors. Represent each scoop as a star. Think of going down the counter one flavor at a time: you see vanilla first, and skip to the next, chocolate. You say yes to chocolate three times (use three stars), then switch to the next flavor. You keep skipping until you get to cherry, which you say yes to twice. Another switch and you are at mint chocolate chip. You say yes once. Then you keep switching until you get past the last flavor, never saying yes again (since you already have said yes six times). There are ten flavors to choose from, so we must switch from considering one flavor to the next nine times. These are the nine bars.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now that we are confident that we have the right number of stars and bars, we answer the question simply: there are 6 stars and 9 bars, so 15 symbols. We need to pick 9 of them to be bars, so the number of milkshakes possible is</div>
