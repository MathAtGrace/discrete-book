<div class="para">Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings from a list of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\text{.}\)</span> Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings, you need to pick <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> toppings to not put on the pizza. You have <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-k}\)</span> choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}\text{.}\)</span>
