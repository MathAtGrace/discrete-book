<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is either prime or can be written as the product of primes.” We will prove <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(2)\)</span> is true because <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is indeed prime.</div> <div class="para">Inductive case: assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\text{.}\)</span> We want to show that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true. That is, we want to show that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is either prime or is the product of primes. If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime, we are done. If not, then <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has more than 2 divisors, so we can write <span class="process-math">\(n = m_1 \cdot m_2\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> less than <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (and greater than 1). By the inductive hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> are each either prime or can be written as the product of primes. In either case, we have that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is written as the product of primes.</div> <div class="para">Thus by the strong induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 2\text{.}\)</span>
