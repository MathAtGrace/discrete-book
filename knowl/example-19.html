<div class="para">Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would write a function, does not mean that the rule is a function. The following are NOT functions.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f:\N \to \N\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = \frac{n}{2}\text{.}\)</span> The reason this is not a function is because not every input has an output. Where does <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> send 3? The rule says that <span class="process-math">\(f(3) = \frac{3}{2}\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> is not an element of the codomain.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone number. If you think of the set of people as the domain and the set of phone numbers as the codomain, then this is not a function, since some people have two phone numbers. Switching the domain and codomain sets doesn't help either, since some phone numbers belong to multiple people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are reading this).</div></li>
