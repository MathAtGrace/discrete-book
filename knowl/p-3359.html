<div class="para">What would a direct proof look like? Since the statement starts with a universal quantifier, we would start by, ``Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be an arbitrary integer." The rest of the statement is an implication. In a direct proof we assume the “if” part, so the next line would be, “Assume <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is greater than 2 and is even.” I have no idea what comes next, but eventually, we would need to find two prime numbers <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> (depending on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) and explain how we know that <span class="process-math">\(n = p+q\text{.}\)</span>
