Since different edges incident to the same vertex will be colored differently, no player will be playing two different games (edges) at the same time.

</div> <div class="para">Notice that for sure <span class="process-math">\(\chi'(K_6) \ge 5\text{,}\)</span> since there is a vertex of degree 5. It turns out 5 colors is enough (go find such a coloring). Therefore the friends will play for 5 hours.</div>
