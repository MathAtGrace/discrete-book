<li><div class="para">No. The 9 triangles each contribute 3 edges, and the 6 pentagons contribute 5 edges. This gives a total of 57, which is exactly twice the number of edges, since each edge borders exactly 2 faces. But 57 is odd, so this is impossible.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now adding up all the edges of all the 16 polygons gives a total of 64, meaning there would be 32 edges in the polyhedron. We can then use Euler's formula <span class="process-math">\(v - e + f = 2\)</span> to deduce that there must be 18 vertices.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you add up all the vertices from each polygon separately, we get a total of 64. This is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be that each vertex belongs to exactly 3 faces. Could they all belong to 4 faces? That would mean there were <span class="process-math">\(64/4 = 16\)</span> vertices, but we know from Euler's formula that there must be 18 vertices. We can write <span class="process-math">\(64 = 3x + 4y\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (as integers). We get that there must be 10 vertices with degree 4 and 8 with degree 3. (Note the number of faces joined at a vertex is equal to its degree in graph theoretic terms.)</div></li>
