<div class="para"> There are four possibilities when it comes to order and repeats. If order matters and repeats are allowed, the answer will look like <span class="process-math">\(n^k\text{.}\)</span> If order matters and repeats are not allowed, we have <span class="process-math">\(P(n,k)\text{.}\)</span> If order doesn't matter and repeats are allowed, use stars and bars. If order doesn't matter and repeats are not allowed, use <span class="process-math">\({n\choose k}\text{.}\)</span> But be careful: this only applies when you are selecting things, and you should make sure you know exactly what you are selecting before determining which case you are in.</div>
