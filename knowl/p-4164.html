<div class="para">We have seen how to find generating functions from <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-x}\)</span> using multiplication (by a constant or by <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>), substitution, addition, and differentiation. To use each of these, you must notice a way to transform the sequence <span class="process-math">\(1,1,1,1,1\ldots\)</span> into your desired sequence. This is not always easy. It is also not really the way we have analyzed sequences. One thing we have considered often is the sequence of differences between terms of a sequence. This will turn out to be helpful in finding generating functions as well. The sequence of differences is often simpler than the original sequence. So if we know a generating function for the differences, we would like to use this to find a generating function for the original sequence.</div>
