<li><div class="para">5632. There are <span class="process-math">\(2^{11}\)</span> strings that start with 011, and another <span class="process-math">\(2^{12}\)</span> which end with 01 (we choose 1 or 0 for 12 bits). However, we count the strings that start with 011 and end with 01 twice - there are <span class="process-math">\(2^{9}\)</span> such strings. So using PIE, we have <span class="process-math">\(2^{11} + 2^{12} - 2^{9} = {5632}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">624. There are <span class="process-math">\({11 \choose 3} = 165\)</span> strings of weight 5 which start with 011, and another <span class="process-math">\({12 \choose 4} ={495}\)</span> which end with 01. We have over counted again - there are weight 5 strings which both start with 011 and end with 01, in fact <span class="process-math">\({9 \choose 2} ={36}\)</span> of them. So all together we have <span class="process-math">\(165+{495}-{36} = {624}\)</span> strings.</div></li>
