<div class="para">How are these numbers related? Notice that <span class="process-math">\(P(14,6)\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">much</em> larger than <span class="process-math">\({14 \choose 6}\text{.}\)</span> This makes sense. <span class="process-math">\({14 \choose 6}\)</span> picks 6 friends, but <span class="process-math">\(P(14,6)\)</span> arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say exactly how much larger <span class="process-math">\(P(14,6)\)</span> is. In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> ways. So now we have <span class="process-math">\(3003\cdot 6!\)</span> choices and that is exactly <span class="process-math">\(2162160\text{.}\)</span>
