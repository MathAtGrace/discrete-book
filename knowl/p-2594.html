<div class="para">With great power, comes great responsibility. Induction isn't magic. It seems very powerful to be able to assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. After all, we are trying to prove <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true and the only difference is in the variable: <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> vs. <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Are we assuming that what we want to prove is true? Not really. We assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true only for the sake of proving that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true.</div>
