<section class="paragraphs"><h2 class="heading"><span class="title"><em class="emphasis">Investigate!</em> activities.</span></h2> <div class="para">Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very beginning of a topic) you will find activities designed to get you acquainted with the topic soon to be discussed. These are similar (sometimes identical) to group activities I give students to introduce material. You really should spend some time thinking about, or even working through, these problems before reading the section. By priming yourself to the types of issues involved in the material you are about to read, you will better understand what is to come. There are no solutions provided for these problems, but don't worry if you can't solve them or are not confident in your answers. My hope is that you will take this frustration with you while you read the proceeding section. By the time you are done with the section, things should be much clearer.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-2.html#qjG" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
