<div class="para">Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14. So the answer is <span class="process-math">\(P(14, 6)\text{,}\)</span> which can be calculated as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{14!}{8!} = 2162160\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_counting-combperm.html#VAr" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
