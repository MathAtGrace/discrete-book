<div class="para">The first half of this is easy: <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is connected, because there is a path between every pair of vertices.  To show that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no cycles, we assume it does, for the sake of contradiction.  Let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be two distinct vertices in a cycle of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>  Since we can get from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> by going clockwise or counterclockwise around the cycle, there are two paths from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> contradicting our assumption.</div>
