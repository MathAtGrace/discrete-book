<div class="para">The interesting thing here, is that a <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\)</span> square now has area 13. Our goal is the find a formula for the area of a <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> (diagonal) square.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Write out the first few terms of the sequence of areas (assume <span class="process-math">\(a_1 = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_2 = 5\text{,}\)</span> etc). Is the sequence arithmetic or geometric? If not, is it the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic or geometric sequence? Explain why your answer is correct, referring to the diagonal squares.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Use your results from part (a) to find a closed formula for the sequence. Show your work. Note, while there are lots of ways to find a closed formula here, you should use partial sums specifically.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Find the closed formula in as many other interesting ways as you can.</div></li>
