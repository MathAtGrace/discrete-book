<div class="para">There might be statements which really cannot be rephrased as implications. For example, “<span class="process-math">\(\sqrt 2\)</span> is irrational.” In this case, it is hard to know where to start. What can we assume? Well, say we want to prove the statement <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> What if we could prove that <span class="process-math">\(\neg P \imp Q\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> was false? If this implication is true, and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false, what can we say about <span class="process-math">\(\neg P\text{?}\)</span> It must be false as well, which makes <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> true!</div>
