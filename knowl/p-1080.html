<div class="para">It should be clear that in each case above, we have the right answer. All we had to do is phrase the question correctly and it became obvious that <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 3}\)</span> is correct. However, this does not tell us that the answer is in fact 10 in each case. We will eventually find a formula for <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\text{,}\)</span> but for now, look back at how we arrived at the answer 10 in our counting problems above. It all came down to bit strings, and we have a recurrence relation for bit strings:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
|\B^n_k| = |\B^{n-1}_{k-1}| + |\B^{n-1}_k|\text{.}
\end{equation*}
