<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “it takes <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> breaks to reduce a <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-square chocolate bar to single squares.”</div> <div class="para">Base case: Consider <span class="process-math">\(P(2)\text{.}\)</span> The squares must be arranged into a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 2\)</span> rectangle, and we require <span class="process-math">\(2-1 = 1\)</span> breaks to reduce this to single squares.</div> <div class="para">Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(n\ge 2\)</span> and assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\text{.}\)</span> Consider a <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-square rectangular chocolate bar. Break the bar once along any row or column. This results in two chocolate bars, say of sizes <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> That is, we have an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>-square rectangular chocolate bar, a <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>-square rectangular chocolate bar, and <span class="process-math">\(a+b = n\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We also know that <span class="process-math">\(a \lt n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b \lt n\text{,}\)</span> so by our inductive hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(P(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P(b)\)</span> are true. To reduce the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>-square bar to single squares takes <span class="process-math">\(a-1\)</span> breaks; to reduce the <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>-square bar to single squares takes <span class="process-math">\(b-1\)</span> breaks. Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares. All together it took the initial break, plus the <span class="process-math">\(a-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b-1\)</span> breaks, for a total of <span class="process-math">\(1+a-1+b-1 = a+b-1 = n-1\)</span> breaks. Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true.</div> <div class="para">Therefore, by strong induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 2\text{.}\)</span>
