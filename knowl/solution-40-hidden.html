<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a function. So is <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp c \amp b \end{pmatrix} \qquad g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp a \amp b \end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">However, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (<span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:13.75%;margin-right:13.75%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:24.8275862068966%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/not-function-a.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Three black dots in a row above and two white dots in a row below.  An arrow points from the left black dot to the left white dot and from the right black dot to the right white dot."></div>
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:37.2413793103448%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/not-function-b.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Three black dots in a row above and four white dots in a row below.  Two arrows point from the left black dot to each of the two left-most white dots.  Each of the other black dots have an arrow pointing down to the white dots below and slightly to the right of them."></div>
</div></div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> We would have something like:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
h=\twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4}{\amp a,c? \amp d \amp b}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always “work”.</div>
