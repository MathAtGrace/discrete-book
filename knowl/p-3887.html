<div class="para">At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always easy. Graphs for which <span class="process-math">\(\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)\)</span> are called <em class="emphasis">class 1</em>, while the others are called <em class="emphasis">class 2</em>. Bipartite graphs always satisfy <span class="process-math">\(\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)\text{,}\)</span> so are class 1 (this was proved by KÃ¶nig in 1916, decades before Vizing proved his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) \ge 8\)</span> are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with <span class="process-math">\(2 \le \Delta(G) \le 5\text{.}\)</span> Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) = 6\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) = 7\)</span> are class 1; the <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) = 7\)</span> case was proved in 2001 by Sanders and Zhao; the <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) = 6\)</span> case is still open.</div>
