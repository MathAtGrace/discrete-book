<div class="para">The graph on the left is <span class="process-math">\(K_6\text{.}\)</span> The only way to properly color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic number is 6.</div> <div class="para">The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green). For example:</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 25%; margin-left: 37.5%; margin-right: 37.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/image-131.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Six vertices arranged in a triangle (with three vertices along each side).  Six edges form the outside of the triangle, and three edges connect the center vertices of each side (in an upside-down triangle).  The bottom row of vertices are labeled R, B, G (left to right), the middle row of vertices are labeled G, R, and to top vertex is labeled B."></div> <div class="para">There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the chromatic number is 3.</div> <div class="para">The graph on the right is just <span class="process-math">\(K_{2,3}\text{.}\)</span> As with all bipartite graphs, this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.</div>
