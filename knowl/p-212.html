<div class="para">The main thing to realize is that we do not know the colors of these two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a yellow square and purple circle.  We could have a square that was not yellow but a purple circle.  Or we could have a square that was not yellow and a circle that was not purple.  The case in which the square is yellow but the circle is not purple cannot occur, as that would make the statement false.</div>
