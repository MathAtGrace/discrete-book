<div class="para">It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with. But this cannot happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be <span class="process-math">\(9\cdot 7 = 63\text{.}\)</span> This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with <span class="process-math">\(31.5\)</span> edges. That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an <em class="emphasis">even</em> number of people at the seminar.</div>
