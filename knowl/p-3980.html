<div class="para">One way <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> not adjacent to any vertex in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (so having degree 0). What else? What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them. Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this way with more and more students. </div>
