<div class="para">Below is a graph representing friendships between a group of students (each vertex is a student and each edge is a friendship). Is it possible for the students to sit around a round table in such a way that every student sits between two friends? What does this question have to do with paths?</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 30%; margin-left: 35%; margin-right: 35%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/graph-10-friends.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A complicated graph containing 9 vertices arranged in a circle.
