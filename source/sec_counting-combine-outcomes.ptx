			<em>Combinatorics</em> is about counting, but looking at the word, we see it really deals with how things <em>combine</em>.
			In this section we will consider two very different ways that we can combine the outcomes we count in combinatorics problems.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before we start, a quick note about the language we use to talk about counting problems.
			Most counting problems here are asked in terms of counting the number of ways something can happen.
			That is, there is some <em>event</em> that can result in different <em>outcomes</em>, and it is the different outcomes that are counted.
			We can take a less <q>active</q> view by asking for the number of elements in a set, such as the set of bit strings of a particular length and weight.
			But this can always be rephrased as asking how many ways you can select one of the elements in that set (how many choices do you have for a bit string of that length and weight, for example).
		</p>

		<p>
			Regardless of our phrasing, we can think of every counting problem as asking for the number of elements in a set of <em>outcomes</em>.
			At the most basic level, counting is not hard at all: just list out all of the outcomes in a numbered list and see how many numbers you use.
			Let me tell you about my bow tie collection.
			I have,
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						A purple bow tie.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						A green bow tie.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						A striped bow tie.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						A paisley bow tie.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			How many bow ties do I have (how many ways can I select a bow tie)?  Well, the largest number in my numbered list is 4, so I have four bow ties.<fn>Obviously this example is quite outdated; only four bow ties?  What sort of mathematician do you take me for?</fn> Of course, as we saw in the previous section, we can use shortcuts to avoid listing out all of the outcomes, such as using Pascal's triangle to find the number of items in our list.
		</p>

		<p>
			Where counting begins to get intersting is when we want to make a new list that combines two or more lists we have already counted.
			For example, if in addition to my list of four bow ties, I had a list of seven pairs of novelty socks, I could ask how many choices I have if I wanted to wear either a cool bow tie or a pair of novelty socks.
			Okay, combine my two lists to make a new list with 11 items: perhaps first list the four bow ties and then keep counting (starting with 5 for the first pair of socks) until you have listed the seven additional items, ending at 11.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this example, we have combined our two sets of outcomes (picking a bow tie and picking a pair of socks) to get a new set of outcomes (picking a bow tie or pair of socks).
			That resulting set of outcomes contained 11 elements.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now consider the question: how many choices do I have if I want to wear both a bow tie and a pair of novelty socks?  Again, I need to combine my two sets of outcomes to get a new set of outcomes.
			But this new set of outcomes will contain 28 elements.
			How did I know that I should multiply the number of elements in each of my original sets, instead of add them?  We are once again combining outcomes: the resulting set of outcomes that contains 28 elements are all outcomes consisting of a bow tie and a pair of socks.
			Now read the previous paragraph!  They sound very close to each other!
		</p>

		<p>
			While this example is simple, the difference between the two scenarios is subtle.
			There are two ways we can think of combining outcomes: we can combine the <em>sets</em> of outcomes, or we can combine the <em>outcomes</em> in the sets.
			Being able to distinguish between these operations is a key skill in combinatorics.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="eg-counting-magnets">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose your refrigerator door has some magnetic letters and numerals on it: There are five letters (A, B, C, D, and E) and three numerals (1, 2, and 3).
					Your brother says that if you combine these sets of magnets, you will get a collection of 8 magnets.
					Your sister says that you can combine these magnets in 15 ways.
				</p>
        <p>
          What sets of outcomes are your siblings thinking of?
        </p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Your brother is thinking of combining the sets of outcomes.
					The set of outcomes for the letters is <m>\{A, B, C, D, E\}</m> and the set of outcomes for the numerals is <m>\{1, 2, 3\}</m>.
					The set of outcomes for the combined set of magnets is <m>\{A, B, C, D, E, 1, 2, 3\}</m>, which contains 8 elements.
        </p>
        
        <p>
					Your sister is thinking of combining the outcomes themselves.
					The outcomes for the combined set of magnets are <m>\{A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3, E1, E2, E3\}</m>, which contains 15 elements.

		<title>The Sum and Product Principles</title>
		<p>
			Let's carefully write down the rules we can use to combine sets of outcomes and outcomes in sets.
		</p>


		<principle>
			<title>Sum Principle</title>
			<idx><h>sum principle</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					If an event <m>A</m> results in <m>m</m> outcomes, and event <m>B</m> results in <m>n</m> <em>disjoint</em> outcomes, then the event <q><m>A</m> or <m>B</m></q> results in <m>m + n</m> outcomes.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>

		<p>
			<idx><h>disjoint events</h></idx>
			It is important that the events be <term>disjoint</term>:
			i.e., that there is no way for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to both happen at the same time.
			For example,
			a standard deck of 52 cards contains <m>26</m> red cards and <m>12</m> face cards.
			However, the number of ways to select a card which is either red or a face card is not <m>26 + 12 = 38</m>.
			This is because there are 6 cards which are both red and face cards.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					<idx><h>word (counting)</h></idx>
					How many two letter <q>words</q>
					start with either A or B? (A <term>word</term>
					is just a sequence of letters;
					it doesn't have to be English, or even pronounceable.)
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					First, how many two letter words start with A? We just need to select the second letter,
					which can be accomplished in 26 ways.
					So there are 26 words starting with A.
					There are also 26 words that start with B.
					To select a word which starts with either A or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or the second 26, for a total of 52 words.
				</p>

				<p>
					We have two sets of outcomes: the words starting with A and the words starting with B.
					We create a new set of outcomes by combining the sets to get the set of words that start with either A or B, and by the sum principle, this new set contains 52 outcomes.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			The sum principle also works with more than two events.
			Say, in addition to your four bow ties and seven pairs of socks,
			you could also pick one of five belt buckles?
			How many choices do you have now?
			You would have <m>4+7+5 = 16</m> options.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="eg-vowel-word-sum">
			<statement>
				<p>
					How many two letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					There are 26 two letter words starting with A, another 26 starting with E, and so on.
					By the sum principle, the total number of words will then be <m>26+26+26+26+26 = 130</m>
					Of course it would be easier to just multiply <m>5\cdot 26</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose you are going for some fro-yo.
					You can pick one of 6 yogurt choices, and one of 4 toppings.
					How many choices do you have?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Break your choices up into disjoint sets of outcomes:
					<m>A</m> are outcomes with the first topping,
					<m>B</m> the outcomes featuring the second topping, and so on.
					Each set of outcomes contain six desserts
					(one for each yogurt flavor).
					The events are disjoint,
					so the total number of outcomes is <m>6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Note that in both of the previous examples,
			when using the sum principle on a bunch of outcome sets of the same size, it is quicker to multiply.
			Let's take advantage of this observation and state it as a new principle.
		</p>


		<principle>
			<title>Product Principle</title>
			<idx><h>product principle</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					If event <m>A</m> can occur in <m>m</m> ways,
					and each possibility for <m>A</m> allows for exactly <m>n</m> ways for event <m>B</m>,
					then the event <q><m>A</m> and <m>B</m></q>
					can occur in <m>m \cdot n</m> ways.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>

    <p>
      A nice way to picture the product principle is to think of the outcomes as <q>levels</q> in a tree. To illustrate this, consider the counting question of <xref ref="eg-counting-magnets"/>: how many ways can you select a letter from <m>\{A, B, C, D, E\}</m> followed by a numeral from <m>\{1, 2, 3\}</m>? Here is a tree picture that shows what is going on.
    </p>

        \end{tikzpicture}
      </latex-image>
    </image>

    <p>
      Each leaf of the tree corresponds to an outcome, and we can easily that we are repeating the three outcomes of the second level five times, once for each outcome of the first level.
    </p>

		<example xml:id="eg-vowel-word-product">
			<statement>
				<p>
					How many two letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?  This time use the product principle to answer the question.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					How can we think of of selecting a two letter word as a sequence of two events that both happen?  Event <m>A</m> is <q>selecting the vowel that starts the word.</q>  Event <m>B</m> is <q>selecting the second letter for the word.</q>  By the product principle, there are <m>5 \cdot 26 = 130</m> ways for the event <q><m>A</m> and <m>B</m></q> to occur.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Of course the solutions to <xref ref="eg-vowel-word-sum"/> and <xref ref="eg-vowel-word-product"/> are the same, but the outcomes we are combining and the ways we are combining them are different.
		</p>

		<p>
			When applying the sum principle, we combined five disjoint sets of outcomes.
			One such set of outcomes was,
			<me>
				\{AA, AB, AC, AD,\ldots, AZ\}
			</me>
			and another was,
			<me>
				\{EA, EB, EC, ED, \ldots, EZ\}
			</me>.
			That is, each set of outcomes was a set of 2-letter words, starting with a different vowel.
			The sum principle combined these five sets to create a new set that contained exactly the same elements in the original sets, just all together in one set.
		</p>

		<p>
			On the other hand, when we applied the product principle, we combined the outcomes in two sets.
			The first set was,
			<me>
				\{A, E, I, O, U\}
			</me>
			and the second set was,
			<me>
				\{A, B, C, D, \ldots, Z\}
			</me>.
			The product principle combines the elements in those sets to make a set of new outcomes (outcomes not present in any of the sets being combined).
		</p>



		<p>
			The product principle generalizes to more than two events as well.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					How many license plates can you make out of three letters followed by three numerical digits?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Here we have six events: the first letter, the second letter, the third letter, the first digit, the second digit, and the third digit.
					The first three events can each happen in 26 ways; the last three can each happen in 10 ways.
					So the total number of license plates will be <m>26\cdot 26\cdot 26 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10</m>, using the product principle.
				</p>

				<p>
					Does this make sense? Think about how we would pick a license plate.
					How many choices we would have? First, we need to pick the first letter.
					There are 26 choices.
					Now for each of those, there are 26 choices for the second letter: 26 second letters with first letter A, 26 second letters with first letter B, and so on.
					We add 26 to itself 26 times.
					Or quicker: there are <m>26 \cdot 26</m> choices for the first two letters.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now for each choice of the first two letters, we have 26 choices for the third letter.
					That is, 26 third letters for the first two letters AA, 26 choices for the third letter after starting AB, and so on.
					There are <m>26 \cdot 26</m> of these <m>26</m> third letter choices, for a total of <m>(26\cdot26)\cdot 26</m> choices for the first three letters.
					And for each of these <m>26\cdot26\cdot26</m> choices of letters, we have a bunch of choices for the remaining digits.
				</p>

				<p>
					In fact, there are going to be exactly 1000 choices for the numbers.
					We can see this because there are 1000 three-digit numbers (000 through 999).
					This is 10 choices for the first digit, 10 for the second, and 10 for the third.
					The product principle says we multiply: <m>10\cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					All together, there were <m>26^3</m> choices for the three letters, and <m>10^3</m> choices for the numbers, so we have a total of <m>26^3 \cdot 10^3</m> choices of license plates.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Careful: <q>and</q> doesn't mean <q>times.</q> For example, how many playing cards are both red and a face card? Not <m>26 \cdot 12</m>.
			The answer is 6, and we needed to know something about cards to answer that question.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more like the product principle but the answer is not <m>26 \cdot 12</m> here either.
			The problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that <em>for each</em> of those there are 12 ways to select the second card.
			If the first card was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second card.<fn> To solve this problem, you could break it into two cases.
			First, count how many ways there are to select the two cards when the first card is a red non-face card.
			Second, count how many ways when the first card is a red face card.
			Doing so makes the events in each separate case independent, so the product principle can be applied.
			</fn>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Remember that a function sends each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain.
					To determine a function,

					Where can we send 1?
					There are 4 choices.
					Where can we send 2?
					Again, 4 choices.
					What we have here is 5 <q>events</q>
					(picking the image of an element in the domain)
					each of which can happen in 4 ways
					(the choices for that image).
					Thus there are <m>4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 4^5</m> functions.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is more than just an example of how we can use the product principle in a particular counting question.
					What we have here is a general interpretation of certain applications of the product principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects:
					functions.
					Whenever we have a counting question that asks for the number of outcomes of a repeated event,
					we can interpret that as asking for the number of functions from <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>
					(where <m>n</m> is the number of times the event is repeated)
					to <m>\{1,2,\ldots,k\}</m>
					(where <m>k</m> is the number of ways that event can occur).

		<title>Counting With Sets</title>
		<p>
			Do you believe the sum and product principles? How would you convince someone they are correct? This is surprisingly difficult.
			They seem so simple, so obvious.
			But why do they work?
		</p>

		<p>
			To make things clearer, and more mathematically rigorous, we will use  sets.
			Do not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying to give a proof of these principles, but we are doing a lot more.
			If we understand the sum and product principles rigorously, we will be better at applying them, and knowing when and when not to apply them at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will look at the sum and product principles in a slightly different way.
			Instead of thinking about event <m>A</m> and event <m>B</m>, we want to think of a set <m>A</m> and a set <m>B</m>.
			The sets will contain all the different ways the event can happen.
			(It will be helpful to be able to switch back and forth between these two models when checking that we have counted correctly.) Here's what we mean:
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose you own 9 shirts and 5 pairs of pants.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								How many outfits can you make?
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								If today is half-naked-day, and you will wear only a shirt or only a pair of pants, how many choices do you have?
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					By now you should agree that the answer to the first question is <m>9 \cdot 5 = 45</m> and the answer to the second question is <m>9 + 5 = 14</m>.
					These are the product and sum principles.
					There are two events: picking a shirt and picking a pair of pants.
					The first event can happen in 9 ways and the second event can happen in 5 ways.
					To get both a shirt and a pair of pants, you multiply.
					To get just one article of clothing, you add.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now look at this using sets.
					There are two sets, call them <m>S</m> and <m>P</m>.
					The set <m>S</m> contains all 9 shirts so <m>|S| = 9</m> while <m>|P| = 5</m>, since there are 5 elements in the set <m>P</m> (namely your 5 pairs of pants).
					What are we asking in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want <m>|S \cup P|</m>, the number of elements in the union of shirts and pants.
					This is just <m>|S| + |P|</m> (since there is no overlap; <m>|S \cap P| = 0</m>).
					Question 1 is slightly more complicated.
					Your first guess might be to find <m>|S \cap P|</m>, but this is not right (there is nothing in the intersection).
					We are not asking for how many clothing items are both a shirt and a pair of pants.
					Instead, we want one of each.
					We could think of this as asking how many pairs <m>(x,y)</m> there are, where <m>x</m> is a shirt and <m>y</m> is a pair of pants.
					As we will soon verify, this number is <m>|S| \cdot |P|</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			From this example we can see right away how to rephrase our sum principle in terms of sets:
		</p>


		<principle>
			<title>Sum Principle (with sets)</title>
			<idx><h>sum principle</h><h>using sets</h></idx>
			<idx><h>cardinality</h><h>of a union</h></idx>
			<idx><h>union of sets</h><h>cardinality of</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, if <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>
					(that is, if there is no element in common to both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>),
					then
					<me>
						\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B}
					</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>

		<p>
			This hardly needs a proof.
			To find <m>A \cup B</m>, you take everything in <m>A</m> and throw in everything in <m>B</m>.
			Since there is no element in both sets already, you will have <m>\card{A}</m> things and add <m>\card{B}</m> new things to it.
			This is what adding does! Of course, we can easily extend this to any number of disjoint sets.
		</p>

		<p>
			From the example above, we see that in order to investigate the product principle carefully, we need to consider ordered pairs.
			We should define this carefully:
		</p>

		<definition>
			<title>Cartesian Product</title>
			<idx><h>Cartesian product</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Given sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we can form the <em>set</em>
					<me>
						A \times B = \{(x,y) \st x \in A \wedge y \in B\}
					</me>
					to be the set of all ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> where <m>x</m> is an element of <m>A</m> and <m>y</m> is an element of <m>B</m>.
					We call <m>A \times B</m> the <term>Cartesian product</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let <m>A = \{1,2\}</m> and <m>B=\{3,4,5\}</m>.
					Find <m>A \times B</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					We want to find ordered pairs <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>a</m> can be either <m>1</m> or <m>2</m> and <m>b</m> can be either 3, 4, or 5.
					<m>A \times B</m> is the set of all of these pairs:
					<me>
						A \times B = \{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\}
					</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			The question is, what is <m>\card{A \times B}</m>? To figure this out, write out <m>A \times B</m>.
			Let <m>A = \{a_1,a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_m\}</m> and <m>B = \{b_1,b_2, b_3, \ldots, b_n\}</m> (so <m>\card{A} = m</m> and <m>\card{B} = n</m>).
			The set <m>A \times B</m> contains all pairs with the first half of the pair being some <m>a_i \in A</m> and the second being one of the <m>b_j \in B</m>.
			In other words:
			<md>
				<mrow>A \times B = \{ \amp (a_1, b_1), (a_1, b_2), (a_1, b_3), \ldots (a_1, b_n),</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp (a_2, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_2, b_3), \ldots, (a_2, b_n),</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp (a_3, b_1), (a_3, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots, (a_3, b_n),</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp \vdots</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp (a_m, b_1), (a_m, b_2), (a_m, b_3), \ldots, (a_m, b_n)\}</mrow>
			</md>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Notice what we have done here: we made <m>m</m> rows of <m>n</m> pairs, for a total of <m>m \cdot n</m> pairs.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each row above is really <m>\{a_i\} \times B</m> for some <m>a_i \in A</m>.
			That is, we fixed the <m>A</m>-element.
			Broken up this way, we have
			<me>
				A \times B = (\{a_1\} \times B) \cup (\{a_2\} \times B) \cup (\{a_3\}\times B) \cup \cdots \cup (\{a_m\} \times B)
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			So <m>A \times B</m> is really the union of <m>m</m> disjoint sets.
			Each of those sets has <m>n</m> elements in them.
			The total (using the sum principle) is <m>n + n + n + \cdots + n = m \cdot n</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To summarize:
		</p>

			<statement>
				<p>
					Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
					we have <m>\card{A \times B} = \card{A} \cdot \card{B}</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>

		<p>
			Again, we can easily extend this to any number of sets.
