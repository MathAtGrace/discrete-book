            <m>a_n = n^2 + n</m>.
            Here we know that we are looking for a quadratic because the second differences are constant.
            So <m>a_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>.
            Since <m>a_0 = 0</m>, we know <m>c= 0</m>.
            So just solve the system

            Suppose <m>a_n = n^2 + 3n + 4</m>.
            Find a closed formula for the sequence of differences by computing <m>a_n - a_{n-1}</m>.
          </p>
          <instruction>
            <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = </m> <var name="$ans" width="10"/>

        <solution>
          <p>
            <m>a_{n-1} = (n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 4 = n^2 + n + 2</m>.
            Thus <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2n+2</m>.
            Note that this is linear
            (arithmetic).
            We can check that we are correct.
            The sequence <m>a_n</m> is
            <m>4, 8, 14, 22, 32, \ldots</m> and the sequence of differences is thus
            <m>4, 6, 8, 10,\ldots</m> which agrees with <m>2n+2</m>
            (if we start at <m>n = 1</m>).

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Generalize <xref ref="ex-quad-diff"/>: Find a closed formula for the sequence of differences of <m>a_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>.
        That is, prove that every quadratic sequence has arithmetic differences.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>a_{n-1} = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) + c = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c</m>.
        Therefore <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2an - a + b</m>, which is arithmetic.
        Notice that this is not quite the derivative of <m>a_n</m>,
        which would be <m>2an + b</m>, but it is close.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Can you use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47,
        <ellipsis/>?
        Explain why or why not.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence so no differences will be constant.
      </p>
    </solution>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Will the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences of <m>2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \ldots</m> ever be constant?
        Explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula <m>2\cdot 3^n</m>.
        This is an exponential function,
        which is not equal to any polynomial of any degree.
        If the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences was constant,
        then the closed formula for the original sequence would be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial.
