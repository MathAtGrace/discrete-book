  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p> For a given predicate <m>P(x)</m>, you might believe that the statements <m>\forall x P(x)</m> or <m>\exists x P(x)</m> are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case? You have four choices: you could give an example of an element <m>n</m> in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is true or for which <m>P(n)</m> if false, or you could argue that no matter what <m>n</m> is, <m>P(n)</m> is true or is false. <ol>
          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true? </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false? </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is true? </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is false? </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> The claim that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> means that <m>P(n)</m> is true no matter what <m>n</m> you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true is to check or otherwise argue that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n</m> in the domain. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> To prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is false. This is often called a <term>counterexample</term>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> We are simply claiming that there is some element <m>n</m> in the domain of discourse for which <m>P(n)</m> is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Here we are claiming that no element we find will make <m>P(n)</m> true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that <em>every</em> element of the domain makes <m>P(n)</m> false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true. </p>
          </li>

    <statement>
      <p> Suppose <m>P(x)</m> is some predicate for which the statement <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true. Is it also the case that <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is true? In other words, is the statement <m>\forall x P(x) \imp \exists x P(x)</m> always true? Is the converse always true? Assume the domain of discourse is non-empty. </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p> Try an example. What if <m>P(x)</m> was the predicate, <q><m>x</m> is prime</q>? What if it was <q>if <m>x</m> is divisible by 4, then it is even</q>? Of course examples are not enough to prove something in general, but that is entirely the point of this question. </p>

      <p> For each of the statements below, give a domain of discourse for which the statement is true, and a domain for which the statement is false. <ol>

        Simplifying negations will be especially useful when we try to prove a
        statement by considering what would happen if it were false. For each statement below, write
        the <em>negation</em> of the statement as simply as possible. Don't just say, <q>it is false that <ellipsis /></q> 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Every number is either even or odd.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
        There is a sequence that is both arithmetic and geometric.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
        For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n+3</m> is not prime. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        It might help to translate the statements into symbols and then use the formulaic rules to
        simplify negations (i.e., rules for quantifiers and De Morgan's laws). After simplifying,
        you should get <m>\forall x(\neg E(x) \wedge \neg O(x))</m>, for the first one, for example.
        Then translate this back into English. </p>

        We can simplify statements in predicate logic using our rules for passing negations
        over quantifiers, and then applying propositional logical equivalence to the <q>inside</q>
        propositional part. Simplify the statements below (so negation appears only directly next to
        predicates). <ol>
          <li>
            <m>\neg \exists x \forall y (\neg O(x) \vee E(y))</m>. </li>

        \forall y \neg(x \lt y \wedge \exists z (x \lt z \vee y \lt z))</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <p> There is a number <m>
        n</m> for which no other number is either less <m>n</m> than or equal to <m>n</m>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
        It is false that for every number <m>n</m> there are two other numbers which <m>n</m> is between. </p>

            <m>\exists x \forall y (x \ge y \vee \forall

      <p> Consider the statement, <q>For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n</m> is solitary.</q> You do not need to know what <em>solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not. <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which. Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Write the negation of the original statement. What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false? </p>

          <li>
            <p> Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement <q>if 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary</q> true or false? Explain. </p>

  <!-- <exercise> <introduction> <p> Consider the statement, <q>For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n</m> is solitary.</q> You do not need to know what <em>solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not. </p> </introduction> <task> <statement> <p> Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which. Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of. </p> </statement> <solution> <p> The converse: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is solitary, then <m>n</m> is prime. The contrapositive: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is not solitary, then <m>n</m> is not prime. </p> </solution> </task> <task> <statement> <p> Write the negation of the original statement. What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false? </p> </statement> <solution> <p> The negation: There is a natural number <m>n</m> which is prime <em>and</em> not solitary. So to prove the original statement false, we need to find one example of a number which is prime but not solitary. </p> </solution> </task> <task> <statement> <p> Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement <q>if 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary</q> true or false? Explain. </p> </statement> <solution> <p> This statement is true. The hypothesis of the statement is false (10 is not prime), so the implication is automatically true. </p> </solution> </task> <task> <statement> <p> It turns out that 8 is solitary. Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive? Explain. </p> </statement> <solution> <p> This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement). All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary. However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime. </p> </solution> </task> <task> <statement> <p> Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em>set</em> <m>P</m> of prime numbers and the <em>set</em> <m>S</m> of solitary numbers. Explain. </p> </statement> <solution> <p> We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers. Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true. </p> </solution> </task> </exercise> -->
