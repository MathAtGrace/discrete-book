    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point
        <m>c</m>, then it is continuous at
        <m>c</m>, but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example,
        <m>f(x) = |x|</m> at the point 0).
        Restate this fact using <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable at a point
        <m>c</m>, it is necessary for the function to be continuous at
        <m>c</m>.
        However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at
        <m>c</m> for it to be continuous at
        <m>c</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true that to be continuous at a point
        <m>c</m>, it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at
        <m>c</m>.
        However, it is not the case that being continuous at
        <m>c</m> is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at
        <m>c</m>.
