    <statement>
      <p>
        Your Blu-ray collection consists of 9 comedies and 7 horror movies.
        Give an example of a question for which the answer is:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              16.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              63.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For example, 16 is the number of choices you have if you want to watch one movie,
              either a comedy or horror flick.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For example, 63 is the number of choices you have if you will watch two movies,
              first a comedy and then a horror.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be sets.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Find <m>\card{(A \cup C)\setminus B}</m> provided
            <m>\card{A} = 50</m>, <m>\card{B} = 45</m>,
            <m>\card{C} = 40</m>, <m>\card{A\cap B} = 20</m>,
            <m>\card{A \cap C} = 15</m>,
            <m>\card{B \cap C} = 23</m>, and <m>\card{A \cap B \cap C} = 12</m>.
          </li>

          <li>
            Describe a set in terms of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
            and <m>C</m> with cardinality 26.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For part (a) you could use the formula for PIE, but for part (b) you might be better off drawing a Venn diagram.

    <statement>
      <p>
        For how many three digit numbers (100 to 999) is the
        <em>sum of the digits</em> even? (For example,
        <m>343</m> has an even sum of digits:
        <m>3+4+3 = 10</m> which is even.) Find the answer and explain why it is correct in at least two
        <em>different</em> ways.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You could consider cases.  For example, any number of the form ODD-ODD-EVEN will have an even sum.  Alternatively, how many three digit numbers have the sum of their digits even if the first two digits are 54?  What if the first two digits are 19?

    <statement>
      <p>
        The number 735000 factors as <m>2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^2</m>.
        How many divisors does it have?
        Explain your answer using the multiplicative principle.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For a simpler example, there are 4 divisors of <m>6 = 2\cdot 3</m>.  They are <m>1 = 2^0\cdot 3^0</m>, <m>2 = 2^1\cdot 3^0</m>, <m>3 = 2^0\cdot 3^1</m> and <m>6 = 2^1\cdot 3^1</m>.
