    <statement>
      <p> Suppose <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are the statements: <m>P</m>: Jack passed math. <m>Q</m>: Jill passed math. <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Translate <q>Jack and Jill both passed math</q> into symbols. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Translate <q>If Jack passed math, then Jill did not</q> into symbols. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Translate <q>
                <m>P \vee Q</m>
              </q> into English. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Translate <q>
                <m>\neg(P \wedge Q) \imp Q</m>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Suppose you know that if Jack passed math, then so did Jill. What can you conclude if you know that: <ol>
                <li>Jill passed math?</li>

                <li>Jill did not pass math?</li>
              </ol>

    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><m>P \wedge Q</m>.</li>

          <li><m>P \imp \neg Q</m>.</li>

          <li>
            <p> Jack passed math or Jill passed math (or both). </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> If Jack and Jill did not both pass math, then Jill did. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Nothing else.</li>

                <li>Jack did not pass math either.</li>
              </ol>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p> Consider the statement <q>If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk.</q>

          <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Write the converse of the statement. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Write the contrapositive of the statement. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Is it possible for the contrapositive to be false? If it was, what would that tell you? </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar drinks milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain. </p>
          </li>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p> Write each of the following statements in the form, <q> if <ellipsis />, then <ellipsis />.</q> Careful, some of the statements might be false (which is alright for the purposes of this question). <ol>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> If you have lost weight, then you exercised. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> If you exercise, then you will lose weight. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> If you are American, then you are patriotic. </p>

          <li>
            <p> If a number is rational, then it is real. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> If a number is not even, then it is prime. (Or the contrapositive: if a number is not prime, then it is even.) </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> If the Broncos don't win the Super Bowl, then they didn't play in the Super Bowl. Alternatively, if the Broncos play in the Super Bowl, then they will win the Super Bowl. </p>

  <exercise> <statement> <p> Consider the implication, <q>if you clean your room, then you can watch TV.</q> Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse. </p> </statement> <hint> <p> Of course there are many answers. It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is <em>not</em> true. Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways. Some ideas: Use <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language, use <q>only if,</q> consider negations, use <q>or else</q> language. </p> </hint> </exercise>
