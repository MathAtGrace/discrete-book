          </li>

          </li>

          <li>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar drinks milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain. </p>
          </li>

  <exercise> 
    <statement> <p> Consider the implication, <q>if you clean your room, then you can watch TV.</q> Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse. </p> 
    </statement> 
    <hint> <p> Of course there are many answers. It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is <em>not</em> true. Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways. Some ideas: Use <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language, use <q>only if,</q> consider negations, use <q>or else</q> language. </p> </hint>
