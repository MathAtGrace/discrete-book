    <statement>
      <p> For a given predicate <m>P(x)</m>, you might believe that the statements <m>\forall x P(x)</m> or <m>\exists x P(x)</m> are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case? You have four choices: you could give an example of an element <m>n</m> in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is true or for which <m>P(n)</m> if false, or you could argue that no matter what <m>n</m> is, <m>P(n)</m> is true or is false. <ol>
          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true? </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false? </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is true? </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is false? </p>

    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> The claim that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> means that <m>P(n)</m> is true no matter what <m>n</m> you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true is to check or otherwise argue that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n</m> in the domain. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> To prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is false. This is often called a <term>counterexample</term>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> We are simply claiming that there is some element <m>n</m> in the domain of discourse for which <m>P(n)</m> is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Here we are claiming that no element we find will make <m>P(n)</m> true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that <em>every</em> element of the domain makes <m>P(n)</m> false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true. </p>
