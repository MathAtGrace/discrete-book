    <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that the candy machine currently holds exactly 650 Skittles,
          and every time someone inserts a quarter,
          exactly 7 Skittles come out of the machine.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                How many Skittles will be left in the machine after 20 quarters have been inserted?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Will there ever be exactly zero Skittles left in the machine?
                Explain.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Is there a pair of integers <m>(a,b)</m> such that
        <m>a,
        x_1, y_1, b</m> is part of an arithmetic sequences and
        <m>a,
        x_2, y_2, b</m> is part of a geometric sequence with <m>x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2</m> all integers?

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sequence <m>2, 7, 15, 26, 40, 57, \ldots</m>
        (with <m>a_0 = 2</m>).
        By looking at the differences between terms,
        express the sequence as a sequence of partial sums.
        Then find a closed formula for the sequence by computing the <m>n</m>th partial sum.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We have <m>2 = 2</m>, <m>7 = 2+5</m>,
        <m>15 = 2 + 5 + 8</m>, <m>26 = 2+5+8+11</m>, and so on.
        The terms in the sums are given by the arithmetic sequence <m>b_n = 2+3n</m>.
        In other words, <m>a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n (2+3k)</m>.
        To find the closed formula, we reverse and add.
        We get <m>a_n = \frac{(4+3n)(n+1)}{2}</m>
        (we have <m>n+1</m> there because there are <m>n+1</m> terms in the sum for <m>a_n</m>).

    <statement>
      <p>
        Starting with any rectangle, we can create a new,
        larger rectangle by attaching a square to the longer side.
        For example, if we start with a <m>2\times 5</m> rectangle,
        we would glue on a <m>5\times 5</m> square,
        forming a <m>5 \times 7</m> rectangle:

        The next rectangle would be formed by attaching a

              Create a sequence of rectangles using this rule starting with a <m>1\times 2</m> rectangle.
              Then write out the sequence of <em>perimeters</em> for the rectangles
              (the first term of the sequence would be 6, since the perimeter of a
              <m>1\times 2</m> rectangle is 6 - the next term would be 10).

              Are the sequences arithmetic?
              Geometric?
              If not, are they <em>close</em>
              to being either of these (i.e., are the differences or ratios
              <em>almost</em> constant)?

        If you have enough toothpicks,
        you can make a large triangular grid.
        Below, are the triangular grids of size 1 and of size 2.
        The size 1 grid requires 3 toothpicks,
        the size 2 grid requires 9 toothpicks.

        Here is a surprising use of sequences to answer a counting question:  How many license plates consist of 6 symbols, using only the three numerals 1, 2, and 3 and the four letters a, b, c, and d, so that no numeral appears after any letter?  For example, <q>31ddac</q>, <q>123321</q>, and <q>ababab</q> are each acceptable license plates, but <q>13ba2c</q> is not.
        <ol>
          <li>

              First answer this question by considering different cases: how many of the license plates contain no numerals?  How many contain one numeral, etc.
