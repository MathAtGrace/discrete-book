    <statement>
      <p>
        Your Blu-ray collection consists of 9 comedies and 7 horror movies.
        Give an example of a question for which the answer is:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              16.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              63.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For example, 16 is the number of choices you have if you want to watch one movie,
              either a comedy or horror flick.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For example, 63 is the number of choices you have if you will watch two movies,
              first a comedy and then a horror.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>
