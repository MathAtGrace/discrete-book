    <statement>
      <p>
        Each of the counting problems below can be solved with stars and bars.
        For each, say what outcome the diagram
        <me>
          ***|*||**|
        </me>
        represents, if there are the correct number of stars and bars for the problem.
        Otherwise, say why the diagram does not represent any outcome,
        and what a correct diagram would look like.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways are there to select a handful of 6 jellybeans from a jar that contains 5 different flavors?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways can you distribute 5 identical lollipops to 6 kids?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many 6-letter words can you make using the 5 vowels in alphabetical order?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many solutions are there to the equation
              <m>x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 6</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              You take 3 strawberry, 1 lime, 0 licorice, 2 blueberry and 0 bubblegum.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This is backwards.
              We don't want the stars to represent the kids because the kids are not identical,
              but the stars are.
              Instead we should use 5 stars
              (for the lollipops)
              and use 5 bars to switch between the 6 kids.
              For example,
              <me>
                **||***|||
              </me>
              would
              represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops,
              the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This is the word AAAEOO.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This doesn't represent a solution.
              Each star should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should
              <em>switch</em>
              between the different variables.
              We have one too many bars.
              An example of a correct diagram would be
              <me>
                *|**||***
              </me>,
              representing that
              <m>x_1 = 1</m>,
              <m>x_2 = 2</m>,
              <m>x_3 = 0</m>, and
              <m>x_4 = 3</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Solve the three counting problems below.
        Then say why it makes sense that they all have the same answer.
        That is, say how you can interpret them as each other.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways are there to distribute 8 cookies to 3 kids?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many solutions in non-negative integers are there to
              <m>x+y+z = 8</m>?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many different packs of 8 crayons can you make using crayons that come in red,
              blue and yellow?
            </p>
