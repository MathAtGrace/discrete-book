    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      So far we have seen how the logical form of a statement we wish to prove can inform how the build the scaffolding of a proof.  The proof structure can only get us so far though: to flesh out the proof skeleton requires understanding of the mathematical objects and structures the proofs are about.  Some of this can come from carefully reading definitions.  Yet there is also some less concrete understanding and intuition that comes from working with the objects and structures that can lead to that <q>ah-ha!</q> moment of inspiration that suggests how to proceed with a proof.

        Why are we writing proofs?  Besides practice for becoming better reasoners, diving into careful proofs about discrete structures is a way to learn more about the structures themselves.  They are a playground for exploring mathematics, to help us build intuition for mathematical structures.  So we study structures to help us write proofs about them, and we write proofs about them to help understand the structures.  Bootstrapping!

    <p>
      Some discrete structures lend themselves to particular styles of proof and there are some <q>standard</q> proof techniques that apply to particular structures.  We will see some of this here, but mostly we take this opportunity to remind ourselves of some of the basic definitions and properties for discrete structures, and use the proofs about them to help understand these better.
