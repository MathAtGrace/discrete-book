    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      So far we have seen how the logical form of a statement we wish to prove can inform how the build the scaffolding of a proof.  The proof structure can only get us so far though: to flesh out the proof skeleton requires understanding of the mathematical objects and structures the proofs are about.  Some of this can come from carefully reading definitions.  Yet there is also some less concrete understanding and intuition that comes from working with the objects and structures that can lead to that <q>ah-ha!</q> moment of inspiration that suggests how to proceed with a proof. 
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Why are we writing proofs?  Besides practice for becoming better reasoners, diving into careful proofs about discrete structures is a way to learn more about the structures themselves.  They are a playground for exploring mathematics, to help us build intuition for mathematical structures.  So we study structures to help us write proofs about them, and we write proofs about them to help understand the structures.  Bootstrapping!
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Some discrete structures lend themselves to particular styles of proof and there are some <q>standard</q> proof techniques that apply to particular structures.  We will see some of this here, but mostly we take this opportunity to remind ourselves of some of the basic definitions and properties for discrete structures, and use the proofs about them to help understand these better.

    <title>Proofs about Sets</title>
    <p>
      Recall that a set is an unordered collection of elements.  We can describe a set by listing these elements, or by specifying a property that elements in the set all satisfy.  For example, 
      <me>
        A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}
      </me>,
      or 
      <me>
        B = \{x \in \N \st x \lt 10 \}
      </me>.
      The second set here is the set of natural numbers (<m>0, 1, 2, \ldots</m>) less than 10.  Notice that every element in <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.  Here is a definition that captures that idea.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-subset" label="def-subset">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A set <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of a set <m>B</m>, written <m>A \subseteq B</m>, provided every element of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We say <m>A</m> is a <term>proper subset</term> of <m>B</m>, written <m>A \subset B</m>, provided <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>A \neq B</m>.  In other words, if every element of <m>A</m> is an element in <m>B</m>, and there is at least one element in <m>B</m> that is <em>not</em> in <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A = \{x \in \N \st x \lt 5\}</m> and <m>B = \{ x \in \N \st x^2 \lt 10\}</m>.  Is <m>B \subseteq A</m>?  Is <m>B</m> a <em>proper</em> subset of <m>A</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We are asking whether every natural number less than 5 is also a natural number whose square is less than 10.  Okay, we could just write out the elements of the sets: <m>A = \{0,1,2,3,4\}</m> and <m>B = \{0,1,2,3\}</m> (since <m>3^2 = 9</m> and <m>4^2 = 16</m>).  So <m>B \subseteq A</m>.  But <m>B \neq A</m>, so in fact <m>B \subset A</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The sets in the example above were small and easy enough to write down the elements of the sets.  However, we can also prove subset relationships between sets if this isn't practical or even possible (perhaps the sets are infinite).  Let's look carefully at how we could have reasoned about the example above.
    </p>

    <p>
      We claimed that every element of <m>B</m> was also an element of <m>A</m>.  Another way to say this: for all numbers <m>n</m>, <em>if</em> <m>n</m> is an element of <m>B</m>, <em>then</em> <m>n</m> is also an element of <m>A</m>. Recognizing this as a conditional statement, we can proceed to give a direct, contrapositive, or contradiction proof of the fact.  Here a direct proof would be perfectly acceptable.  Let's try it:
    </p>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be an element of the set <m>B</m>.  Then <m>n^2 \lt 10</m>, by the definition of <m>B</m>.  Since <m>4^2 = 16</m>, we must have that <m>n \lt 4</m>.  By the definition of <m>A</m>, and the fact that <m>4 \lt 5</m>, we see that <m>n \in A</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      To be clear, this proof is <em>way</em> more than we would normally do for this example, but its format should be illuminating.  Proving that one set is a subset of another is really the same as proving an implication!
    </p>

    <p>
      To give an example of how we can apply the definition of subset in a more general setting, let's prove a basic fact about subsets.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-subset">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq C</m>, then <m>A \subseteq C</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We will give a direct proof.  Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be sets, and assume that <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq C</m>.  We will prove that <m>A \subseteq C</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> be an element of <m>A</m>.  Since <m>A \subseteq B</m>, we know that <m>x \in B</m>.  Since <m>B \subseteq C</m>, we know that <m>x \in C</m>.  Therefore, <m>A \subseteq C</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
