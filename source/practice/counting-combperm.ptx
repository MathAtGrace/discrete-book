    <statement>
      <p>
        How many triangles are there with vertices from the points shown below?
        Note, we are not allowing degenerate triangles - ones with all three vertices on the same
        line,
        but we do allow non-right triangles.
        Explain why your answer is correct.

            An <em>anagram</em> of a word is a rearrangement of its letters
            (each of the letters must be used exactly once).
            We do not need the anagram to form an English word.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  How many anagrams are there of the word <q>magic</q>?
                  Explain.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <var name="$ans1" width="5"/>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  How many anagrams are there of the word <q>abracadabra</q>?
                  Explain.
                  Note that you need to figure out how to deal with the repeated letters (starting with the first
                  <q>a</q> and then the second <q>a</q>
                  gives the same word as starting with the second <q>a</q>
                  and then the first <q>a</q>.
                </p>

                  A <em>sub-anagram</em> is just like an anagram except now you don't need to use all of the letters
                  (but you could).
                  So one sub-anagram of <q>magic</q> is <q>mac.</q>
                  How many sub-anagrams are there of the word <q>magic</q>?
                  Explain.
                  Hint: you might want to break this into cases.

                <p>
                  There are <m>120 = 5!</m> anagrams.
                  We can pick any of the 5 distinct letters to put first,
                  then any of the remaining 4, and so on.
                  We could also have written this <m>P(5,5)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We need to place 5 a's, 2 b's, 2 r's, and one each of c and d.
                  So first select 5 of the eleven slots for the a's, which can be done in <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> ways.
                  Then select 2 of the remaining 6 slots for b's, done in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways.
                  Next pick 2 of the remaining 4 slots of r's, in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways,
                  and finally pick one of the two available spots for the c leaving the last for the d.
                  Thus all together the number of anagrams is:
                  <me>
                    {11\choose 5}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}2\cdot 1 = 83160
                  </me>.
                  (Note, if you pick a different letter to start with,
                  you get a different looking answer,
                  but the final product should be the same.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another approach: Think of all of the letters as different
                  (so there are 5 a's, but maybe written in 5 different fonts,
                  for example.)
                  In this case, there would be <m>11!</m> anagrams.
                  Now to correct for the repeated letters,
                  group all the anagrams that just have different arrangements of the a's, b's and r's into groups.
                  Each group would have <m>5!\cdot 2! \cdot 2!</m> different anagrams
                  (since there are <m>5!</m> ways to arrange the a's, <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the b's and <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the r's).
                  We just need to count groups, so the total is
                  <me>
                    \frac{11!}{5!2! 2!} = 83160
                  </me>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We already know there are 120 5-letter sub-anagrams.
                  To find the 4-letter sub-anagrams,
                  we need to pick one of 5 letters first, then one of remaining,
                  then one of 3 after that and one of the remaining 2.
                  Thus there are <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 120</m> of these as well
                  (we could think of these as exactly the 120 full anagrams with the last letter missing).
                  There will be <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60</m> 3-letter sub-anagrams,
                  <m>5\cdot 4 = 20</m> 2-letter sub-anagrams,
                  and <m>5</m> 1-letter sub-anagrams.
                  All together, this brings the number of sub-anagrams to
                  <me>
                    120 + 120 + 60 + 20 + 5 = 325
                  </me>.
