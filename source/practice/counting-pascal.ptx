<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Compute the following sums of the rows of Pascal's triangle:
      <!-- Add some binomial coefficient sums -->
       Now based on your work in the above calculations, give a guess for the sum of the 10th row of Pascal's triangle.

  <statement>
    <p>
      A pizza parlor offers 10 different toppings, one of which is pineapple.
      How many 4-toppings pizzas are there that have pineapple as one of their toppings?  How many 4-topping pizzas are there that do not have pineapple as a topping?  How many 4-topping pizzas are there in total?
      Ask to give the choose notation for all of these.
