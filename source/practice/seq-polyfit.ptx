  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sequence <m>1, 3, 7, 13, 21, \ldots</m>.
        Explain how you know the closed formula for the sequence will be quadratic.
        Then <q>guess</q> the correct formula by comparing this sequence to the squares <m>1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots</m>
        (do not use polynomial fitting).
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>a_n = n^2 - n + 1</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use a similar technique as in the previous exercise to find a closed formula for the sequence <m>2, 11, 34, 77, 146, 247,\ldots</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>a_n = n^3 + n^2 - n + 1</m>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Generalize <xref ref="ex-quad-diff"/>: Find a closed formula for the sequence of differences of <m>a_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>.
        That is, prove that every quadratic sequence has arithmetic differences.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>a_{n-1} = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) + c = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c</m>.
        Therefore <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2an - a + b</m>, which is arithmetic.
        Notice that this is not quite the derivative of <m>a_n</m>,
        which would be <m>2an + b</m>, but it is close.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Can you use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47,
        <ellipsis/>?
        Explain why or why not.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence so no differences will be constant.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Will the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences of <m>2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \ldots</m> ever be constant?
        Explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula <m>2\cdot 3^n</m>.
        This is an exponential function,
        which is not equal to any polynomial of any degree.
        If the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences was constant,
        then the closed formula for the original sequence would be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial.

        In their down time,
        ghost pirates enjoy stacking cannonballs in triangular based pyramids (aka,
        tetrahedrons), like those pictured here:

      <p>
        Note, these are solid tetrahedrons,
        so there will be some cannonballs obscured from view (the picture on the right has one cannonball in the back not shown in the picture,
        for example)

      <p>
        The pirates wonder how many cannonballs would be required to build a pyramid 15 layers high
        (thus breaking the world cannonball stacking record).
        Can you help?

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>P(n)</m> denote the number of cannonballs needed to create a pyramid <m>n</m> layers high.
              So <m>P(1) = 1</m>, <m>P(2) = 4</m>, and so on.
              Calculate <m>P(3)</m>, <m>P(4)</m> and <m>P(5)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Use polynomial fitting to find a closed formula for <m>P(n)</m>.
              Show your work.

              Answer the pirate's question:
              how many cannonballs do they need to make a pyramid 15 layers high?
