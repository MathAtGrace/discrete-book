  <title>Quantifiers and Predicate Logic</title>

  <subsection>
    <title>Beyond
      Propositions</title>
    <p> As we saw in <xref ref="sec_logic-statements" />, not every statement can be analyzed using logical connectives alone. For example, we might want to work with the statement: </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        All primes greater than 2 are odd.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> To write this
      statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers. We can translate as follows: <me>
        \forall x ((P(x) \wedge x \gt 2) \imp O(x))
      </me>. In this case, we are using <m>
      P(x)</m> to denote <q><m>x</m> is prime</q> and <m>O(x)</m> to denote <q><m>x</m> is odd.</q> These are not
      propositions, since their truth value depends on the input <m>x</m>. Better to think of <m>P</m> and <m>
      O</m> as denoting <em>properties</em> of their input. The technical term for these is <term>predicates</term>
      and when we study them in logic, we need to use <term>predicate logic</term>. </p>

    <p> It is important
      to stress that predicate logic <em>extends</em> propositional logic (much in the way quantum
      mechanics extends classical mechanics). You will notice that our statement above still used
      the (propositional) logical connectives. Everything that we learned about logical equivalence
      and deductions still applies. However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a
      higher resolution, digging down into the individual propositions <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, etc. </p>

    <p>
      A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text.
      One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether two statements in
      predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no analogue to truth tables here).
      Rather, we end with a two examples of logical equivalence and deduction,
      to pique your interest.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number. We can translate this into symbols as <me>
          \neg \exists x \forall y (x \le y)
          </me> (literally, <q>it is not
          true that there is a number <m>x</m> such that for all numbers <m>y</m>, <m>x</m> is less than or
          equal to <m>y</m></q>). </p>

        <p> However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: we can
          pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type (between universal and
          existential). So the statement above should be <em>logically equivalent</em> to <me>
            \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
          </me>. Notice that <m>y \lt x</m> is
          the negation of <m>x \le y</m>. This literally says, <q>for every number <m>x</m> there is a number <m>
          y</m> which is smaller than <m>x</m>.</q> We see that this is another way to make our
          original claim. </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p> Can you switch the order of
          quantifiers? For example, consider the two statements: <me>
            \forall x \exists y P(x,y) \qquad \mathrm{ and } \qquad \exists y \forall x P(x,y)
          </me>.
          Are these logically equivalent? </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p> These statements are NOT logically
          equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate <m>P(x,y)</m>
          which makes one of the statements true and the other false. </p>

        <p> Let <m>P(x,y)</m> be the
          predicate <m>x \lt y</m>. It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all <m>x</m> there is
          some <m>y</m> greater than that <m>x</m> (since there are infinitely many numbers). However,
          there is not a natural number <m>y</m> which is greater than every number <m>x</m>. Thus it is
          possible for <m>\forall x \exists y P(x,y)</m> to be true while <m>\exists y \forall x P(x,y)</m>
          is false. </p>

        <p> We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some <m>y</m> for which
          every <m>x</m> satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>, then certainly for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> which
          satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>. The first is saying we can find one <m>y</m> that works for every <m>x</m>.
          The second allows different <m>y</m>'s to work for different <m>x</m>'s, but there is nothing
          preventing us from using the same <m>y</m> that work for every <m>x</m>. In other words, while
          we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction
          rule: </p>

            <row bottom="minor">
              <cell />
              <cell><m>\exists y \forall x P(x,y)</m>
              </cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell><m>
                  \therefore</m>
              </cell>
              <cell><m>\forall x \exists y P(x,y)</m>
              </cell>

          </tabular>

        </sidebyside>

        <p>
          Put yet another way, this says that the single statement <me>
            \exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
          </me>
          is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for
          necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement in predicate logic that is
          necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a <term>law of logic</term>
              <idx>law of
          logic</idx> (or sometimes <term>logically valid</term>, <idx><h>logically valid</h><see>law of logic</see>
          </idx>
          but that is less fun). </p>
