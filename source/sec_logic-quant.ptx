        <statement>
          <p>
            After thinking about the Investigate! problem above, share your initial thoughts below.  
          </p>
        </statement>

      </exercise>

      <p>
        Consider the following statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For every positive integer <m>n</m>, there is a positive integer <m>m</m> such that if <m>n</m> in prime, then <m>m</m> is prime and larger than <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The statement happens to be true, but for now, just consider it's logical form.  Is the statement atomic or molecular?  Certainly there are logical connectives in there, but is it possible to break the entire statement up into smaller statements?
      </p>

      <p>
        Not really.  We could look at the hypothesis of the implication: <q><m>n</m> is prime.</q>  But that's not a statement, since it contains a variable.  It is neither true nor false, unless we specify what <m>n</m> is.  In the original statement, we did specify this, by saying we are talking about all <m>n</m>.  We cannot apply the same <q>for all</q> to the just this hypothesis though without changing the meaning of the statement.
      </p>

      <p>
        So the statement is atomic.  However, consider the following simpler statement:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          There are infinitely many primes.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Here's the thing.  The two statements are equivalent, and their equivalence has nothing to do with the concept of a prime.  They are equivalent on the basis of their logical form.  This suggests that we need to develop a type of logic that can deal with variables and <term>quantifiers</term> like <q>for all</q> and <q>there exists.</q>

        <title>Statements with variables</title>
        
      <p>
        <idx><h>free variable</h></idx>
        <idx><h>predicate</h></idx>
        
        It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences.
        For example,
        suppose we wanted to claim that if <m>n</m> is prime,
        then <m>n+7</m> is not prime.
        This looks like an implication.
        I would like to write something like
        <me>
          P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7)
        </me>
        where <m>P(n)</m> means <q> <m>n</m> is prime.</q>
        But this is not quite right.
        For one thing, because this sentence has a
        <term>free variable</term>
        (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about),
        it is not a statement.  A sentence that contains variables is called a <term>predicate</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if we plug in a specific value for <m>n</m>, we do get a statement.
        In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for <m>n</m>,
        we get a true implication in this case.
        What we really want to say is that
        <em>for all</em> values of <m>n</m>,
        if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n+7</m> is not.
        We need to <em>quantify</em> the variable.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Although there are many types of
        <em>quantifiers</em> in English (e.g., many, few, most,
        etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two:
        existential and universal.
      </p>
  
      <assemblage>
        <title>Universal and Existential Quantifiers</title>
          <idx><h>quantifier</h></idx>
  
        <p>
          The existential quantifier is
          <m>\exists</m> and is read
          <q>there exists</q> or
          <q>there is.</q> For example,

              <idx><h>quantifier</h><h>there exists</h></idx>

          <me>
            \exists x (x \lt 0)
          </me>
          asserts that there is a number less than 0.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The universal quantifier is
          <m>\forall</m> and is read
          <q>for all</q> or
          <q>every.</q> For example,
              <idx><h>universal quantifier</h></idx>
              <idx><h>quantifier</h><h>for all</h></idx>

          </notation>
  
          <me>
            \forall x (x \ge 0)
          </me>
          asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
  
      <p>
        As with all mathematical statements,
        we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false.
        Consider the statement
        <me>
          \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
        </me>.
        You would read this,
        <q>for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> such that <m>y</m> is less than <m>x</m>.</q> Is this true?
        The answer depends on what our <em>domain of discourse</em> is:
        when we say <q>for all</q> <m>x</m>,
        do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set?
        Usually this information is implied.
        In discrete mathematics,
        we almost always quantify over the
        <em>natural numbers</em>, 0, 1, 2,
        <ellipsis/>, so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        For the statement to be true,
        we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select,
        there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller.
        Perhaps we could let
        <m>y</m> be
        <m>x-1</m>?
        But here is the problem: what if
        <m>x = 0</m>?
        Then
        <m>y = -1</m> and that is
        <em>not a number!</em>
        (in our domain of discourse).
        Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers.
        In symbols,
        <me>
          \exists x \forall y (y \ge x)
        </me>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the
        <em>negation</em> was true.
        Notice how the negation and original statement compare.
        This is typical.

      <p>
        Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier,
        but that causes the quantifier to switch type.
        This should not be surprising:
        if not everything has a property,
        then something doesn't have that property.
        And if there is not something with a property,
        then everything doesn't have that property.

      <p>
        It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics.  Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention.  An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: <m>S(x)</m> standing for <q><m>x</m> is a square</q> and <m>R(x)</m> standing for <q><m>x</m> is a rectangle</q>.  The <em>sentence</em> we are looking at is,
        
        <me>
          S(x) \imp R(x)
        </me>.
        This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement.  But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,
        
        <me>
          \forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))
        </me>,
        
        and this is what our convention tells us to consider.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement.  For example, we might write, <em>let <m>P(n)</m> be the <em>statement</em>, <q><m>n</m> is prime,</q></em> which is technically incorrect.  It is implicit that we mean that we are defining <m>P(n)</m> to be a predicate, which for each <m>n</m> becomes the statement, <m>n</m> is prime.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>  


    <p> As we saw in <xref ref="sec_logic-statements" />, not every statement can be analyzed using logical connectives alone. For example, we might want to work with the statement: </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        All primes greater than 2 are odd.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> To write this
      statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers. We can translate as follows: <me>
        \forall x ((P(x) \wedge x \gt 2) \imp O(x))
      </me>. In this case, we are using <m>
      P(x)</m> to denote <q><m>x</m> is prime</q> and <m>O(x)</m> to denote <q><m>x</m> is odd.</q> These are not
      propositions, since their truth value depends on the input <m>x</m>. Better to think of <m>P</m> and <m>
      O</m> as denoting <em>properties</em> of their input. The technical term for these is <term>predicates</term>
      and when we study them in logic, we need to use <term>predicate logic</term>. </p>

    <p> It is important
      to stress that predicate logic <em>extends</em> propositional logic (much in the way quantum
      mechanics extends classical mechanics). You will notice that our statement above still used
      the (propositional) logical connectives. Everything that we learned about logical equivalence
      and deductions still applies. However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a
      higher resolution, digging down into the individual propositions <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, etc. </p>

    <p>
      A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text.
      One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether two statements in
      predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no analogue to truth tables here).
      Rather, we end with a two examples of logical equivalence and deduction,
      to pique your interest.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number. We can translate this into symbols as <me>
          \neg \exists x \forall y (x \le y)
          </me> (literally, <q>it is not
          true that there is a number <m>x</m> such that for all numbers <m>y</m>, <m>x</m> is less than or
          equal to <m>y</m></q>). </p>

        <p> However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: we can
          pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type (between universal and
          existential). So the statement above should be <em>logically equivalent</em> to <me>
            \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
          </me>. Notice that <m>y \lt x</m> is
          the negation of <m>x \le y</m>. This literally says, <q>for every number <m>x</m> there is a number <m>
          y</m> which is smaller than <m>x</m>.</q> We see that this is another way to make our
          original claim. </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p> Can you switch the order of
          quantifiers? For example, consider the two statements: <me>
            \forall x \exists y P(x,y) \qquad \mathrm{ and } \qquad \exists y \forall x P(x,y)
          </me>.
          Are these logically equivalent? </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p> These statements are NOT logically
          equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate <m>P(x,y)</m>
          which makes one of the statements true and the other false. </p>

        <p> Let <m>P(x,y)</m> be the
          predicate <m>x \lt y</m>. It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all <m>x</m> there is
          some <m>y</m> greater than that <m>x</m> (since there are infinitely many numbers). However,
          there is not a natural number <m>y</m> which is greater than every number <m>x</m>. Thus it is
          possible for <m>\forall x \exists y P(x,y)</m> to be true while <m>\exists y \forall x P(x,y)</m>
          is false. </p>

        <p> We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some <m>y</m> for which
          every <m>x</m> satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>, then certainly for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> which
          satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>. The first is saying we can find one <m>y</m> that works for every <m>x</m>.
          The second allows different <m>y</m>'s to work for different <m>x</m>'s, but there is nothing
          preventing us from using the same <m>y</m> that work for every <m>x</m>. In other words, while
          we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction
          rule: </p>

        <p>
          Put yet another way, this says that the single statement <me>
            \exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
          </me>
          is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for
          necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement in predicate logic that is
          necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a <term>law of logic</term>
              <idx>law of
          logic</idx> (or sometimes <term>logically valid</term>, <idx><h>logically valid</h><see>law of logic</see>
          </idx>
          but that is less fun). </p>
