			Holmes always wears one of the two vests he owns: one tweed and one mint green.
			He always wears either the green vest or red shoes.
			Whenever he wears a purple shirt and the green vest, he chooses to not wear a bow tie.
			He never wears the green vest unless he is also wearing either a purple shirt or red shoes.
			Whenever he wears red shoes, he also wears a purple shirt.
			Today, Holmes is wore a bow tie.
			What else did he wear?
		</p>
		</investigation>

		<exercise label="ip_sec_logic-prop">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Spend a few minutes thinking about the <em>Investigate!</em> problem above.
					Of the six statements in the puzzle, only one is atomic.
					Use this atomic statement and one other statement to deduce a new statement about what Holmes might (or might not) be wearing.
					Explain why you think your new statement is true.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<hint>
				<p>
					The atomic statement is <q>Holmes wore a bow tie.</q>  Only one of the molecular statements has this as one of its <em>atoms</em>.
				</p>
			</hint>
			<response />
		</exercise>

		<p>
			<term>Propositional logic</term> studies the ways statements can interact with each other (the term <q><term>proposition</term></q> is simply a synonym for <q>statement</q>).
			More precisely, we consider the way the logical form of propositions interact.
			Thus, propositional logic does not really care about the content of the atomic statements that make up the propositions.
			For example, in terms of propositional logic, the claims, <q>if the moon is made of cheese, then cheddar is a type of cheese,</q> and <q>if spiders have six legs, then Sam walks with a limp</q> are exactly the same.
			That the first statement has two atomic parts that reference cheese is irrelevant.
			What we care about is that the two molecular statements have the same logical form: they are implications, <m>P \imp Q</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course, in mathematics we often do know some relationship between various atomic statements (for the record, I do not know any such relationship between the moon's composition and cheddar).
			For example, we know a relationship between being even and being a multiple of 10.
			That relationship allows us to make claims such as, <q>if the number I'm thinking of is a multiple of 10, then it is even.</q>  What can you conclude from the fact that I am now thinking of an odd number (i.e., not even)?  If we accept both statements as true, we can deduce that that I am not thinking of a multiple of 10, and importantly, we can make this deduction without thinking about the nature of numbers.
			Being able to separate the content from the form of arguments can feel very liberating and provide much needed clarity when trying to understand complicated reasoning.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our goal in this section is to establish some procedures for analyzing how the truth or falsity of statements interact, based on their logical form.
			We will see that some molecular statements must be true regardless of whether their atomic parts are true or false, while some statements must always be false.
			For other statements, it can be that two statements are always true or false together, or that whenever one statements is true, another statement must also be true.
		</p>

		<p>
			The main method for establishing these relationships will be <term>truth tables</term>.
			There is a very clear procedure for constructing and analyzing truth tables, but for complicated arguments that contain many atomic statements, the truth tables become very large and unwieldy.
			We will therefore use truth tables to understand some basic equivalences and deductions, that can be applied in a sequence of reasoning to construct larger arguments.

		<title>Truth Tables</title> <idx><h>truth table</h> </idx>
		<p>
			Here's a question about playing Monopoly:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				If you get more doubles than any other player then you will lose, or if you lose then you must have bought the most properties.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			True or false? We will answer this question, and won't need to know anything about Monopoly.
			Instead we will look at the logical <em>form</em> of the statement.
		</p>

		<p>
			We need to decide when the statement <m>(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> is true.
			Using the definitions of the connectives in <xref ref="sec_logic-statements" />, we see that for this to be true, either <m>P \imp Q</m> must be true or <m>Q \imp R</m> must be true (or both).
			Those are true if either <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m> is true (in the first case) and <m>Q</m> is false or <m>R</m> is true (in the second case).
			So<mdash />yeah, it gets kind of messy.
			Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities.
			Enter <term>truth tables</term>.
			The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T's and F's (True and False) for each of the propositional variables, and then mark down whether the (molecular) statement in question is true or false in that case.
			We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's.
			Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false.
			For complicated statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values of its parts and how they are connected, all you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives.
			Here they are:

		</tabular>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		The truth table for negation looks like this:
	</p>

	<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center"> <col right="medium" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell> F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell /> </row>
		</tabular>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		None of these truth tables should come as a surprise; they are all just restating the definitions of the connectives.
		Let's try another one.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="ex-imp-disj">
		<statement>
			<p>
				Make a truth table for the statement <m>\neg P \vee Q</m>.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Note that this statement is not <m>\neg(P \vee Q)</m>, the negation belongs to <m>P</m> alone.
				Here is the truth table:
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P \vee Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				We added a column for <m>\neg P</m> to make filling out the last column easier.
				The entries in the <m>\neg P</m> column were determined by the entries in the <m>P</m> column.
				Then to fill in the final column, look only at the column for <m>Q</m> and the column for <m>\neg P</m> and use the rule for <m>\vee</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		Now let's answer our question about monopoly:
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Analyze the statement, <q>if you get more doubles than any other player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the most properties,</q> using truth tables.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Represent the statement in symbols as <m>(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)</m>, where <m>P</m> is the statement <q>you get more doubles than any other player,</q> <m>Q</m> is the statement <q>you will lose,</q> and <m>R</m> is the statement <q>you must have bought the most properties.</q> Now make a truth table.
			</p>

			<p>
				The truth table needs to contain 8 rows in order to account for every possible combination of truth and falsity among the three statements.
				Here is the full truth table:
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>R</m> </cell> <cell><m>P \imp Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q \imp R</m> </cell> <cell><m>(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell> F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				The first three columns are simply a systematic listing of all possible combinations of T and F for the three statements (do you see how you would list the 16 possible combinations for four statements?).
				The next two columns are determined by the values of <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>R</m> and the definition of implication.
				Then, the last column is determined by the values in the previous two columns and the definition of <m>\vee</m>.
				It is this final column we care about.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that in each of the eight possible cases, the statement in question is true.
				So our statement about monopoly is true (regardless of how many properties you own, how many doubles you roll, or whether you win or lose).
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		The statement about monopoly is an example of a <term>tautology</term>, <idx><h>tautology</h> </idx> a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone.
		Tautologies are always true but they don't tell us much about the world.
		No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true.
		In fact, it is equally true that <q>If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.</q>
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Logical Equivalence</title>
	<p>
		You might have noticed in <xref ref="ex-imp-disj" /> that the final column in the truth table for <m>\neg P \vee Q</m> is identical to the final column in the truth table for <m>P \imp Q</m>:
	</p>

	<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>P \imp Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P \vee Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell> F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell> F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row>
		</tabular>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		This says that no matter what <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are, the statements <m>\neg P \vee Q</m> and <m>P \imp Q</m> either both true or both false.
		We therefore say these statements are <term>logically equivalent</term>.
	</p>

	<definition>
		<title>Logical Equivalence</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Two (molecular) statements <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are <term>logically equivalent</term> <idx><h>logical equivalence</h> </idx> provided <m>P</m> is true precisely when <m>Q</m> is true.
				That is, <m> P</m> and <m>Q</m> have the same truth value under any assignment of truth values to their atomic parts.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can make a truth table for each and check whether the columns for the two statements are identical.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recognizing two statements as logically equivalent can be very helpful.
		Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lend insight into what it is saying, or how to prove or refute it.
		By using truth tables we can systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Are the statements, <q>it will not rain or snow</q> and <q>it will not rain and it will not snow</q> logically equivalent?
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				We want to know whether <m>\neg(P \vee Q)</m> is logically equivalent to <m>\neg P \wedge \neg Q</m>.
				Make a truth table which includes both statements:
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg(P \vee Q)</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P \wedge \neg Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell> F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell> T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Since in every row the truth values for the two statements are equal, the two statements are logically equivalent.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		Notice that this example gives us a way to <q>distribute</q> a negation over a disjunction (an <q>or</q>).
		We have a similar rule for distributing over conjunctions (<q>and</q>s):
	</p>

	<theorem>
		<title>De Morgan's Laws</title> <idx><h>De Morgan's laws</h> </idx>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The negation of a disjunction or a conjunction are logically equivalent to conjunctions or disjunctions of negations, respectively.
				That is,
				<me>
					\neg(P \wedge Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \vee \neg Q
				</me>
				and,
				<me>
					\neg(P \vee Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \wedge \neg Q
				</me>.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</theorem>

	<p>
		This suggests there might be a sort of <q>algebra</q> you could apply to statements (okay, there is: it is called <em>Boolean algebra</em>) to transform one statement into another.
		We can start collecting useful examples of logical equivalence, and apply them in succession to a statement, instead of writing out a complicated truth table.
	</p>

	<p>
		De Morgan's laws do not do not directly help us with implications, but as we saw above, every implication can be written as a disjunction:
	</p>

	<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-imp-disj"> <title>Implications are Disjunctions</title> <idx><h>implication</h><h>equivalent disjunction</h> </idx> <idx><h>disjunction</h><h>equivalent implication</h> </idx>
		<p>
			<me>
				P \imp Q \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \vee Q
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Example: <q>If a number is a multiple of 4, then it is even</q> is equivalent to, <q>a number is not a multiple of 4 or (else) it is even.</q>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>
		With this and De Morgan's laws, you can take any statement and <em>simplify</em> it to the point where negations are only being applied to atomic propositions.
		Well, actually not, because you could get multiple negations stacked up.
		But this can be easily dealt with:
	</p>

	<assemblage>
		<title>Double Negation</title>
		<p>
			<idx><h>double negation</h> </idx>
			<me>
				\neg \neg P \text{ is logically equivalent to } P
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Example: <q>It is not the case that <m>c</m> is not odd</q> means <q><m>c</m> is odd.</q>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>
		Let's see how we can apply the equivalences we have encountered so far.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Prove that the statements <m>\neg(P \imp Q)</m> and <m>P\wedge \neg Q</m> are logically equivalent without using truth tables.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				We want to start with one of the statements, and transform it into the other through a sequence of logically equivalent statements.
				Start with <m>\neg(P \imp Q)</m>.
				We can rewrite the implication as a disjunction this is logically equivalent to
				<me>
					\neg(\neg P \vee Q)
				</me>.
				Now apply De Morgan's law to get
				<me>
					\neg\neg P \wedge \neg Q
				</me>.
				Finally, use double negation to arrive at <m>P \wedge \neg Q</m>
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		Notice that the above example illustrates that the negation of an implication is NOT an implication: it is a conjunction! We saw this before, in <xref ref="sec_logic-statements" />, but it is so important and useful, it warrants a second blue box here:
	</p>

	<fact xml:id="assemblage-negimp-again"> <title>Negation of an Implication</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The negation of an implication is a conjunction:
				<me>
					\neg(P \imp Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } P \wedge \neg Q
				</me>.
				That is, the only way for an implication to be false is for the hypothesis to be true <em>AND</em> the conclusion to be false.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</fact>

	<p>
		To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can use truth tables or a sequence of logically equivalent replacements.
		The truth table method, although cumbersome, has the advantage that it can verify that two statements are NOT logically equivalent.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Are the statements <m>(P \vee Q) \imp R</m> and <m>(P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> logically equivalent?
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Note that while we could start rewriting these statements with logically equivalent replacements in the hopes of transforming one into another, we will never be sure that our failure is due to their lack of logical equivalence rather than our lack of imagination.
				So instead, let's make a truth table:
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>R</m> </cell> <cell><m>(P\vee Q) \imp R</m> </cell> <cell><m>(P\imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell> F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell> T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell> T</cell> </row> <row> <cell /> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Look at the fourth (or sixth) row.
				In this case, <m>(P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> is true, but <m>(P \vee Q) \imp R</m> is false.
				Therefore the statements are not logically equivalent.
			</p>

			<p>
				While we don't have logical equivalence, it is the case that whenever <m>(P \vee Q) \imp R</m> is true, so is <m>(P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)</m>.
				This tells us that we can <em>deduce</em> <m>(P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> from <m>(P \vee Q) \imp R</m>, just not the reverse direction.
			</p>

<subsection>
	<title> Deductions</title>
	<p>
		Earlier we claimed that the following was a valid argument:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
			If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie.
			Edith ate her vegetables.
			Therefore Edith gets a cookie.
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		How do we know this is valid? Let's look at the form of the statements.
		Let <m>P</m> denote <q>Edith eats her vegetables</q> and <m>Q</m> denote <q>Edith can have a cookie.</q> The logical form of the argument is then:
	</p>

	<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center"> <row> <cell /> <cell><m>P \imp Q</m> </cell> </row> <row bottom="minor"> <cell /> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell><m>\therefore</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> </row>
		</tabular>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		This is an example of a <term>deduction rule</term>, <idx><h>deduction rule</h> </idx> an argument form which is always valid.
		This one is a particularly famous rule called <foreign>modus ponens</foreign>.
		<idx><h sortby="modus ponens"><em>modus ponens</em> </h> </idx> Are you convinced that it is a valid deduction rule? If not, consider the following truth table:
	</p>

	<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>P\imp Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell> T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row>
		</tabular>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		This is just the truth table for <m>P \imp Q</m>, but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table.
		Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true.
		The premises in this case are <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>P</m>.
		Which <em>rows</em> of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? <m>P</m> is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has <m>P \imp Q</m> true as well.
		And lo-and-behold, in this one case, <m>Q</m> is also true.
		So if <m>P\imp Q</m> and <m>P</m> are both true, we see that <m>Q</m> must be true as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here are a few more examples.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Show that the following is a valid deduction rule.
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <row> <cell /> <cell><m>P \imp Q</m> </cell> </row> <row bottom="minor"> <cell /> <cell><m>\neg P \imp Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell><m>\therefore</m> </cell> <cell><m> Q</m> </cell> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				We make a truth table which contains all the lines of the argument form:
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>P\imp Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P</m> </cell> <cell><m>\neg P \imp Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell> T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				(we include a column for <m>\neg P</m> just as a step to help getting the column for <m>\neg P \imp Q</m>).
			</p>

			<p>
				Now look at all the rows for which both <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>\neg P \imp Q</m> are true.
				This happens only in rows 1 and 3.
				Hey! In those rows <m>Q</m> is true as well, so the argument form is valid (it is a valid deduction rule).
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Decide whether the following is a valid deduction rule.
			</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Let's make a truth table containing all four statements.
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<tabular halign="center"> <col right="minor" /> <col right="minor" /> <col right="medium" /> <col right="minor" /> <col right="minor" /> <col /> <row bottom="minor"> <cell><m>P</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q</m> </cell> <cell><m>R</m> </cell> <cell><m>P \imp R</m> </cell> <cell><m>Q \imp R</m> </cell> <cell><m>P \vee Q</m> </cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell> F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> </row> <row> <cell> F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row> <row> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell> T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> </row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Look at the second to last row.
				Here all three premises of the argument are true, but the conclusion is false.
				Thus this is not a valid deduction rule.
			</p>

			<p>
				While we have the truth table in front of us, look at rows 1, 3, and 5.
				These are the only rows in which all of the statements <m>P \imp R</m>, <m>Q \imp R</m>, and <m>P\vee Q</m> are true.
				It also happens that <m>R</m> is true in these rows as well.
				Thus we have discovered a new deduction rule we know <em>is</em> valid:
			</p>
