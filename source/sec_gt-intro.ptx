        <p>
          In the time of Euler, in the town of Königsberg in Prussia,
          there was a river containing two islands.
          The islands were connected to the banks of the river by seven bridges
          (as seen below).
          The bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off,
          townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges.
          As time passed, a question arose:
          was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross each bridge once and only once?
          Euler was able to answer this question.
          Are you?

        Graph Theory is a relatively new area of mathematics,
        first studied by the super famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1735.
        Since then it has blossomed in to a powerful tool used in nearly every branch of science and is currently an active area of mathematics research.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The problem above, known as the
        <em>Seven Bridges of Königsberg</em>,
        is the problem that originally inspired graph theory.
        Consider a <q>different</q> problem: Below is a drawing of four dots connected by some lines.
        Is it possible to trace over each line once and only once (without lifting up your pencil,
        starting and ending on a dot)?
      </p>

      <p>
        There is an obvious connection between these two problems.
        Any path in the dot and line drawing corresponds exactly to a path over the bridges of Königsberg.

        Pictures like this dot and line drawing are called <term>graphs</term> (although technically, the picture above is a <term>multigraph</term>).
        Graphs are made up of a collection of dots called <term>vertices</term>
            <idx><h>vertex</h></idx>
        and lines connecting those dots called <term>edges</term>.
            <idx><h>edge</h></idx>
        When two vertices are connected by an edge,
        we say they are <term>adjacent</term>.

        The nice thing about looking at graphs instead of pictures of rivers,
        islands and bridges is that we now have a mathematical object to study.
        We have distilled the <q>important</q>
        parts of the bridge picture for the purposes of the problem.
        It does not matter how big the islands are,
        what the bridges are made out of,
        if the river contains alligators, etc.
        All that matters is which land masses are connected to which other land masses,
        and how many times.
        This was the great insight that Euler had.

        We will return to the question of finding paths through graphs in <xref ref="sec_gt-paths"/>.
        But first, here are a few other situations you can represent with graphs:
      </p>
  
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Al, Bob, Cam, Dan,
            and Euler are all members of the social networking website <em>Facebook</em>.
            The site allows members to be <q>friends</q> with each other.
            It turns out that Al and Cam are friends, as are Bob and Dan.
            Euler is friends with everyone.
            Represent this situation with a graph.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each person will be represented by a vertex and each friendship will be represented by an edge.
            That is, two vertices will be adjacent
            (there will be an edge between them)
            if and only if the people represented by those vertices are friends.

          <p>
            Each of three houses must be connected to each of three utilities.
            Is it possible to do this without any of the utility lines crossing?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We will answer this question in <xref ref="sec_gt-planar"/>.
            For now, notice how we would ask this question in the context of graph theory.
            We are really asking whether it is possible to redraw the graph below without any edges crossing.
            Think of the top row as the houses,
            bottom row as the utilities.

      Actually, all the graphs we have seen above are just <em>drawings</em> of graphs. A graph is
      really an abstract mathematical object consisting of two sets <m>V</m> and <m>E</m> where <m>E</m> is a
      set of 2-element subsets of <m>V</m>. Are the graphs below the same or different? <dl width="narrow">

  <p>
    Before we start studying graphs,
    we need to agree upon what a graph is. While we almost always think of graphs as pictures
    (dots connected by lines)
    this is fairly ambiguous.
    Do the lines need to be straight?
    Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are?
    Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?
    Can one line connect three dots?
  </p>

  <p>
    The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous <em>definitions</em>.
    Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important. The definition is the
    agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed. Is there a graph with
    no edges? We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible. </p>

  <p> 
    We want our
    definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree with our intuition for the
    objects we are studying. It needs to be useful: we <em>could</em> define a graph to be a six legged
    mammal, but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges. Instead, here is the (now)
    standard definition of a graph.

  <p>
    Strange. Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines. From the definition, a graph
    could be <me>
      (\{a,b,c,d\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\}\})
    </me>. Here we have
    a graph with four vertices (the letters <m>a, b, c, d</m>) and five edges (the pairs <m>\{a,b\},
    \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\})</m>). </p>

  <p>
  <idx><h>graph</h><h>drawing</h>
    </idx> Looking at sets and
    sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process. That is why we often draw a representation of
    these sets. We put a dot down for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when
    those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges. Thus one way to draw
    the graph described above is this: </p>

  <p>
    We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be <q>the same.</q> Actually, given our
    definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal? Are the edge sets equal? We know what it
    means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets. </p>

  <example>
  <idx><h>equality
        of graphs</h>
    </idx>
  <idx><h>graph</h><h>equality</h>
    </idx>
    <statement>
      <p> Are the graphs below equal? <me>
          G_1 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{b,c\}\}); \qquad G_2 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,c\}, \{c, b\}\})
        </me>
        .
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> No. Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a
        good start. Also, both graphs have two edges. In the first graph, we have edges <m>\{a,b\}</m>
        and <m>\{b,c\}</m>, while in the second graph we have edges <m>\{a,c\}</m> and <m>\{c,b\}</m>. Now we
        do have <m>\{b,c\} = \{c,b\}</m>, so that is not the problem. The issue is that <m>\{a,b\} \ne
        \{a,c\}</m>. Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets), the graphs are
        not equal (as graphs). </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p> Even if two graphs are not <em>equal</em>,
    they might be <em>basically</em> the same. The graphs in the previous example could be drawn like
    this: </p>

    Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called <term>isomorphic</term>. We will
    give a precise definition of this term after a quick example: </p>

      <p> Consider the graphs: <me>

        <me>
        G_2 = (V_2, E_2) \text{ where }
          V_2 = \{u,v,w\} \text{ and }E_2 = \{\{u,v\}, \{u,w\}, \{v,w\}\}.

      <p>
        Are these graphs the same?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> The two graphs are NOT equal.
        It is enough to notice that <m>V_1 \ne V_2</m> since <m>a \in V_1</m> but <m>a \notin V_2</m>.
        However, both of these graphs consist of three vertices with edges connecting every pair of
        vertices. We can draw them as follows: </p>

  <p>
    An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices.
    It must be a bijection so every vertex gets a new name.
    These newly named vertices must be connected by edges precisely when they were connected by
    edges with their old names.

        <m>V_1 = \{a,b,c,d\}</m>, <m>E_1 =
        \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}\}</m>

        \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{c,d\}\}</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> The graphs are NOT equal, since <m>\{a,d\}
        \in E_1</m> but <m>\{a,d\} \notin E_2</m>. However, since both graphs contain the same number
        of vertices and same number of edges, they <em>might</em> be isomorphic (this is not enough in
        most cases, but it is a good start). </p>

      <p> We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we
        say <m>f(a) = b</m>, <m>f(b) = c</m>, <m>f(c) = d</m> and <m>f(d) = a</m>. This is definitely a
        bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it <em>respects
        the edge relation</em>. In <m>G_1</m>, vertices <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are connected by an edge. In <m>
        G_2</m>, <m>f(a) = b</m> and <m>f(b) = c</m> are connected by an edge. So far, so good, but we
        must check the other three edges. The edge <m>\{a,c\}</m> in <m>G_1</m> corresponds to <m>\{f(a),
        f(c)\} = \{b,d\}</m>, but here we have a problem. There is no edge between <m>b</m> and <m>d</m>
        in <m>G_2</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is NOT an isomorphism. </p>

      <p> Not all hope is lost, however. Just
        because <m>f</m> is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We
        can try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should
        match up. </p>

            The graph G2 with four vertices arranged in a diamond. The top vertex (a) is connected
            to the the vertices c below and b on the right. There is two additional edges between d
            (left) and c and between b and c .

      <p>
        Alternatively, notice that in <m>G_1</m>, the vertex <m>a</m> is adjacent to every other vertex.
        In <m>G_2</m>, there is also a vertex with this property: <m>c</m>. So build the bijection <m>g:V_1
        \to V_2</m> by defining <m>g(a) = c</m> to start with. Next, where should we send <m>b</m>? In <m>G_1</m>,
        the vertex <m>b</m> is only adjacent to vertex <m>a</m>. There is exactly one vertex like this in <m>
        G_2</m>, namely <m>d</m>. So let <m>g(b) = d</m>. As for the last two, in this example, we have a
        free choice: let <m>g(c) = b</m> and <m>g(d) = a</m> (switching these would be fine as well). </p>

      <p>
        We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bijection. We must
        make sure that the edges are respected. The four edges in <m>G_1</m> are <me>
          \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}
        </me>. </p>

      <p> Under the proposed
        isomorphism these become <me>
          \{g(a), g(b)\}, \{g(a), g(c)\}, \{g(a), g(d)\}, \{g(c), g(d)\}
        </me>
        <me>
        \{c,d\}, \{c,b\}, \{c,a\}, \{b,a\}
        </me>, which are precisely the edges
        in <m>G_2</m>. Thus <m>g</m> is an isomorphism, so <m>G_1 \cong G_2</m>

    any labels. In this case we are really referring to <em>all</em> graphs isomorphic to any copy of
    that particular graph. A collection of isomorphic graphs is often called an <term>isomorphism class</term>

    We would like to say that the smaller graph is a <em>subgraph</em> of the larger. </p>

  <p>
    We should give a careful definition of this.
    In fact, there are two reasonable notions for what a subgraph should mean.

    Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have
    the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to
    itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called <term>simple</term>, although we will just call them <em>
    graphs</em>. This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of
    2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an
    element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also,
    since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected
    to itself by an edge. </p>

    problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to
    the near shore. We will call these objects <term>multigraphs</term>. This is a good name: a <em>multiset</em>

    </idx> Vertices in a
    graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting
    graph is called <term>complete</term>. That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is
    connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to
    which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give
    these a special name: <m>K_n</m>

    </idx> Each vertex in <m>K_n</m> is adjacent to <m>n-1</m> other vertices. We
    call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the <term>degree</term> of that vertex. So
    every vertex in <m>K_n</m> has degree <m>n-1</m>. How many edges does <m>K_n</m> have? One might think
    the answer should be <m>n(n-1)</m>, since we count <m>n-1</m> edges <m>n</m> times (once for each
    vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice.
    Thus there are <m>n(n-1)/2</m> edges in <m>K_n</m>. Alternatively, we can say there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m>
    edges, since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the <m>n</m> vertices. </p>

  <p> In general, if we know
    the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges. The sum of the
    degrees of all vertices will always be <em>twice</em> the number of edges, since each edge adds to
    the degree of two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any
    graph must be even! </p>
  
  <p>
    This is our first example of a general result about all graphs. It seems innocent enough, but we
    will use it to prove all sorts of other statements. So let's give it a name and state it
    formally.

  <p>
    The handshake lemma<fn>A <em>lemma</em> is a mathematical statement that is primarily of importance in
    that it is used to establish other results.</fn> is sometimes called the <em>degree sum formula</em>,
    and can be written symbolically as <me>
      \sum_{v\in V} d(v) = 2e
    </me>. Here we are using the notation <m>d(v)</m> for the
    degree of the vertex <m>v</m>. </p>

    <idx><h>graph</h><h>degree sequence</h>
    </idx>
    <idx><h>vertex
    degree</h><h>degree sequence</h>
    </idx> One use for the lemma is to actually find the number of
    edges in a graph. To do this, you must be given the <term>degree sequence</term> for the graph (or be
    able to find it from other information). This is a list of every degree of every vertex in the
    graph, generally written in non-increasing order. </p>
  
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p> How many vertices and edges must a graph
        have if its degree sequence is <me>
          (4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1)
        </me>? </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> The number of
        vertices is easy to find: it is the number of degrees in the sequence: 7. To find the number
        of edges, we compute the degree sum: <me>
          4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 20
        </me>, so the number of edges is half
        this: 10. </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    The handshake lemma also tells us what is not possible.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking hands.
        Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7 people at the seminar?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake
        hands with. But this cannot happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have
        each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices
        would be <m>9\cdot 7 = 63</m>. This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting
        in a graph with <m>31.5</m> edges. That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd
        number) of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an <em>even</em> number of people at
        the seminar. </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p> We can generalize the previous example to get
    the following proposition.<fn>A <term>proposition</term> is a general statement in mathematics, similar to
    a theorem, although generally of lesser importance.</fn>
  </p>
  
  <proposition xml:id="prop-evensum">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose there were a graph with an odd number of vertices with odd degree. Then the sum of
        the degrees in the graph would be odd, which is impossible, by the handshake lemma.
      </p>

    We will consider further applications of the handshake lemma in the exercises.
